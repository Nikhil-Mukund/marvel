One major issue is distinguishing true astrophysical signals from those of terrestrial origin. The use of multiple detectors helps to address this challenge, as signals are considered valid only if they appear in coincidence in two or more instruments.\n\n## Challenges in Single-Detector Signal Identification\n\nA major challenge of any search for gravitational waves is to distinguish true astrophysical signals from those of terrestrial origin. Gravitational-wave experiments therefore make use of multiple detectors, considering only those signals which appear in coincidence in two or more instruments. However, when only one detector observes a signal, it becomes difficult to confirm the event. This challenge is associated with identifying signals from a single detector in gravitational wave observations.\n\nThe complexity of confirming events like GW230529 increases when only one gravitational-wave detector observes the signal. This signal, detected during the fourth LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing run (O4), which started on May24,2023, and is planned to last for20 months, is believed to have originated from the merger of a neutron star with a compact object that has a mass between2.5 to4.5 times that of our Sun, placing it within a possible mass-gap between the heaviest known neutron stars and the lightest black holes.\n\n## Notable Events Initially Identified as Single-Detector Triggers\n\nSeveral notable events have been initially identified as single-detector triggers. For example, GW190425 was initially identified as a single-detector trigger, detected by one of three LVC stations, specifically a single LIGO instrument. This event, originally designated S190425z, was considered by some scientists to have been confirmed as a binary neutron star merger, with estimated parameters including a mass of $1.44^{+0.02}_{-0.02}$ and $1.60 -1.87$ for the two neutron stars.\n\nAnother notable event is GW230529, which was initially identified as a single-detector trigger, captured in May2023 by the LIGO Livingston detector in Louisiana, USA. This signal originates from a possible collision between a neutron star and a compact object with a mass that challenges current astrophysical categorizations, potentially bridging the known mass gap between neutron stars and black holes.\n\n## Quantifying Detection Confidences\n\nResearchers have been working on methods to quantify detection confidences in terms of the probability $P(S)$ that a signal candidate is of astrophysical origin. According to a study, loud signal candidates observed with a single Advanced LIGO detector can be assigned $P(S)\\gtrsim0.4$. In the future, Advanced LIGO may be able to observe single-detector events with confidences exceeding $P(S)\\sim90\\%$.\n\n## Impact of Time-Overlapping Compact Binary Coalescences\n\nChallenges are also associated with identifying signals from a single detector in gravitational wave observations, particularly when time-overlapping compact binary coalescences (CBCs) are present. Current methods of gravitational wave detection rely on the assumption that only a single signal is present in the detector and, in most algorithms, that this signal can be matched to modelled signal waveforms. However, this assumption will break for time-overlapping transients.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, identifying signals from a single detector in gravitational wave observations presents several challenges, including distinguishing true astrophysical signals from those of terrestrial origin and dealing with time-overlapping compact binary coalescences. Notable events like GW190425 and GW230529 have been initially identified as single-detector triggers, and researchers continue to develop methods to quantify detection confidences and improve the sensitivity of detectors.\n\n## References\n\n* [New gravitational wave detection challenges astrophysical mass gap theories](https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/New_gravitational_wave_detection_challenges_astrophysical_mass_gap_theories_999.html)\n* [Quantifying the confidence of single-detector gravitational wave signal candidates](https://authors.library.caltech.edu/records/gswx0-dew83)\n* [LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Observing Run](https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/news/ligo20240405)\n* [List of gravitational wave observations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_gravitational_wave_observations)\n* [Physical Review D](https://link.aps.org/accepted/10.1103/PhysRevD.106.104045)", "marvel_standard_score": 7, "marvel_deepsearch_answer": "KEY_FACTS\nMerged Report: Single Detector Gravitational Wave Events\n\nThis report synthesizes information from the original document and the provided additional references to provide a comprehensive overview of the challenges and advancements in detecting and characterizing gravitational wave events using a single detector, and the associated astrophysical implications.\n\nI. Challenges of Single Detector Observations\n\nThe primary challenge in gravitational wave (GW) astronomy is the inherent ambiguity of signals detected by a single detector. Several factors contribute to this:\n\nSky Localization: A single detector cannot determine the direction of the source. This dramatically hinders follow-up observations across the electromagnetic spectrum.\nParameter Estimation: Accurate estimation of source parameters (masses, spins, distance, inclination) is significantly degraded without multi-detector information. The degeneracy of the signal prevents unique solutions.\nFalse Alarm Rates: Distinguishing genuine GW signals from noise transients is more difficult with a single detector, leading to higher false alarm rates. Noise 'glitches' can mimic GW signals, requiring sophisticated analysis techniques to rule them out.\nCalibration Uncertainty: Precise calibration of the detector is critical. Errors in calibration can introduce systematic biases in parameter estimation.\n\nII. Advancements in Single Detector Analysis Techniques\n\nDespite the challenges, progress has been made in extracting information from single-detector GW events through several key advancements:\n\nCoherent WaveBurst Analysis: These methods search for short-duration, broadband signals (wavebursts) without requiring a specific waveform model. They leverage time-frequency representations to identify signal characteristics.\nTime-Frequency Analysis: Analyzing signals in the time-frequency domain can help differentiate GW signals from instrumental noise.\nMatched Filtering with Waveform Templates: While less effective than multi-detector methods, matched filtering can be used to search for signals with known or expected waveform characteristics.\nBayesian Inference: Sophisticated Bayesian statistical methods are employed to estimate source parameters and quantify uncertainties. These methods incorporate prior information and likelihood functions derived from the data.\nGlitch Mitigation: Advanced techniques are being developed to identify and remove instrumental noise 'glitches' from the data. This involves identifying glitch characteristics and subtracting them from the signal.\nStatistical Signal Processing: Techniques like the non-central student's t-test aid in determining the significance of single detector events.\n\nIII. Astrophysical Implications and Potential Sources\n\nSingle detector observations are particularly valuable for exploring sources that may be weakly localized or have unusual characteristics:\n\nCore-Collapse Supernovae: These events produce complex GW signals that are difficult to localize, making single detector observations a valuable tool.\nBinary Neutron Star Mergers (with Weak Electromagnetic Counterparts): While multi-detector observations are preferred, single detector events can provide crucial information about the population of binary neutron star systems.\nBlack Hole Mergers with Extreme Parameters: Mergers involving black holes with high spins or mass ratios may produce signals that are weakly localized or difficult to detect with conventional methods.\nUnmodeled Sources: Single detector observations can be used to search for GW signals from sources that are not well-modeled by existing theoretical waveforms.\nContinuous Wave Signals: Searching for continuous GW signals from rapidly rotating neutron stars is a promising area of research, and single detector observations can provide valuable constraints on the source parameters.\nStochastic Background: Single detector data can be used to search for the stochastic gravitational wave background, a diffuse background of GW signals from a variety of astrophysical sources.\n\nIV. Localization Efforts (despite limitations)\n\nDespite the lack of triangulation, several approaches attempt to improve localization:\n\nEarth Rotation Modulation: Analyzing how the signal varies with Earth's rotation can provide some information about the source direction.\nAntenna Pattern Analysis: Leveraging the detector's antenna pattern can help constrain the source location, though this is limited by the detector's orientation.\nFollow-up Observations: Rapid follow-up observations with electromagnetic telescopes can help identify potential counterparts and improve localization, even with limited initial information. [See Adapt. Physics. WUSTL publications for GRB localization examples.]\nNetwork Analysis: Incorporating data from multiple detectors (even with limited sensitivity) can improve localization accuracy.\n\nV. Current and Future Directions\n\nImproving Detector Sensitivity: Continued improvements in detector sensitivity will increase the detection rate of GW events and improve the signal-to-noise ratio.\nDeveloping Advanced Data Analysis Techniques: New data analysis techniques are needed to extract more information from single detector events and reduce false alarm rates.\nExpanding the Detector Network: Adding new detectors to the network will improve localization accuracy and provide more comprehensive coverage of the sky.\nMulti-Messenger Astronomy: Combining GW observations with electromagnetic, neutrino, and cosmic ray observations will provide a more complete picture of astrophysical phenomena.\nImproved Waveform Modeling: Refining theoretical models of GW waveforms will improve the accuracy of parameter estimation and increase the detection rate of GW events.\n\nReferences (Synthesized from original document and added papers)\n\nOriginal Document: (Details of original document would be inserted here if available)\nAdapt.

I'll structure it to be informative and highlight the challenges and opportunities.\n\nSingle-Detector Gravitational Wave Events: Challenges, Techniques, and Significance\n\n1. Core Challenge: Localization and Confirmation\n\nPoor Localization: The primary difficulty with relying on a single detector is the significantly degraded source localization. With three (or more) detectors, the intersection of signal arrival times narrows down the location in the sky. A single detector provides only a line of sight, leaving the source location undetermined along that line.\nNeed for Follow-up: Confirmation and localization necessitate rapid follow-up observations with electromagnetic telescopes (optical, X-ray, radio) to identify potential counterparts. This is because single-detector events have a high false alarm rate.\nHigh False Alarm Rate: Without the consistency check from multiple detectors, the probability of a random noise fluctuation mimicking a gravitational wave signal is higher. Robust statistical methods are crucial.\n\n2. Event Rates and Source Types\n\nNeutron Star Mergers: Single-detector events are particularly important for detecting neutron star mergers that are weakly oriented towards the detector. These are critical for understanding the formation of heavy elements (r-process nucleosynthesis).\nBinary Black Hole Mergers: Single-detector events can also detect binary black hole mergers, especially those that are poorly oriented or have low signal strength.\nRate estimates Estimates vary and are dependent on detector sensitivity and sky coverage.\n\n3. Techniques to Improve Confidence and Localization\n\nRapid Follow-Up: The most critical step. Electromagnetic follow-up, ideally within hours or even minutes of the gravitational wave detection, is essential to pinpoint the source.\nGamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs): Searching for coincident GRBs is a powerful technique, as many neutron star mergers are expected to produce GRBs.\nStatistical Methods: Advanced statistical techniques are used to evaluate the significance of the signal and estimate the probability of a false alarm. This includes modeling the detector noise and accounting for uncertainties in the signal parameters.\nBayesian Inference: Used to estimate the source parameters (masses, spins, distance, inclination) and their uncertainties, given the observed data.\nCoincident Analysis: Combining single-detector events with other observations (e.g., neutrino detections) can improve confidence.\nSky Maps: Generating sky maps representing the probability distribution of the source location, even with limited localization information.\nCoherent Network Analysis: Utilizing data from multiple detectors, even if the signal is weak in some of them, can improve the signal-to-noise ratio and localization accuracy.\n\n4. Current Status and Future Prospects\n\nIncreasing Sensitivity: Ongoing upgrades to gravitational wave detectors (LIGO, Virgo, KAGRA) are increasing their sensitivity, making it easier to detect weaker signals and more single-detector events.\nThird-Generation Detectors: Future detectors like the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer promise even greater sensitivity and will significantly improve the detection and localization of gravitational wave sources.\nMulti-Messenger Astronomy: The combination of gravitational wave observations with electromagnetic and neutrino observations is revolutionizing our understanding of the universe. Single-detector events play a crucial role in this multi-messenger approach.\n\n5.

Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these points or focus on a specific aspect of single-detector gravitational wave events.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nOkay, here's a consolidated summary of the key points from both reports, combining the information and highlighting improvements based on the new report, formatted for clarity. I've also added a \"Challenges and Future Directions\" section incorporating points from both documents. I will categorize the information for easy access.\n\nConsolidated Summary: Single Detector Gravitational Wave Events\n\nI. Introduction & Significance\n\nSingle-detector gravitational wave (GW) events are observations made by only one GW detector instead of the more common co-incident detections from multiple detectors.\nWhile less precise than multi-detector events, they are crucial for several reasons:\nIncreased Event Rate: They allow for a higher overall detection rate, as they aren't limited by simultaneous operation of all detectors.\nAll-Sky Coverage: They can detect events from regions of the sky not well-observed by the network.\nExploring New Populations: Single detector observations can reveal sources with weak signals or unusual characteristics that might be missed by standard network searches.\nTesting General Relativity: They provide independent tests of general relativity without relying on network triangulation.\n\nII. Challenges of Single Detector Events\n\nLocalization: The primary challenge is poor sky localization. Without triangulation from multiple detectors, determining the precise location of the source is very difficult. This significantly hinders follow-up observations with electromagnetic telescopes.\nNoise and False Alarms: Single detectors are more susceptible to noise transients and terrestrial disturbances, increasing the probability of false positive detections.\nSource Characterization: Precisely measuring the source’s intrinsic parameters (mass, spin, distance) is more difficult.\n\nIII. Techniques & Methods for Improving Single Detector Detections\n\nData Quality Vetting: Rigorous noise reduction and data quality checks are essential to minimize false alarms. Advanced noise subtraction techniques are critical.\nCoherent WaveBurst Searches: Searches focusing on broadband, unmodeled GW signals (wavebursts) can be effective in identifying events that don't match specific waveform templates.\nMatched Filtering with Reduced Templates: Using a smaller set of waveform templates can improve the sensitivity of searches, but requires careful consideration to avoid missing potential sources.\nTime-Frequency Analysis: Techniques like spectrogram analysis can help identify signals buried in noise.\nFollow-up Strategies: Despite poor localization, rapid follow-up observations with electromagnetic telescopes are still valuable, particularly if there are any hints about the source’s location. This is often done by looking at large portions of the sky.\nMulti-messenger Astronomy: Identifying potential electromagnetic counterparts is critical. Collaboration with telescopes operating across the electromagnetic spectrum (radio, optical, X-ray, gamma-ray) is crucial.\nBayesian Inference: Incorporating prior information about potential sources (e.g., from population models) can improve the accuracy of source parameter estimation.\n\nIV. Recent Findings & Event Examples (Combined from both reports)\n\nSeveral single-detector events have been identified in recent years, including events from the O3 and O4 observing runs.\nEvents have been associated with:\nBinary Neutron Stars (BNS): Single-detector observations have confirmed the existence of BNS mergers and provided constraints on their population.\nBinary Black Holes (BBH): Single-detector observations have detected BBH mergers, including events with unusual masses or spins.\nNeutron Star-Black Hole (NSBH): Confirmed several events.\nUnidentified sources: Several events remain unclassified, potentially representing new types of GW sources.\nLocalized Single Detector Events: Some single detector events have achieved modest sky localization through the use of advanced data analysis techniques and statistical inference. In some cases, this has allowed for the identification of potential electromagnetic counterparts.\nImproved Localization: Recent advancements in data analysis techniques (e.g. time-frequency analysis) have led to improved sky localization for some single-detector events.\nAssociation with GRBs: Association of some events with Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) is promising.\n\nV. Challenges and Future Directions\n\nAdvanced Detector Networks: The next generation of GW detectors (e.g., Einstein Telescope, Cosmic Explorer) will dramatically improve the sensitivity and network coverage, reducing the reliance on single-detector events.\nData Analysis Improvements: Continued development of advanced data analysis techniques is crucial for improving the sensitivity and accuracy of single-detector searches. Focus areas include:\nNoise subtraction: More effective noise reduction algorithms.\nWaveform modeling: Accurate waveform templates for a wider range of sources.\nStatistical inference: Incorporating prior information about source populations.\nRapid Follow-up: Improved coordination with electromagnetic telescopes is essential for maximizing the chances of identifying counterparts. This requires:\nReal-time event alerts: Fast and reliable event notification systems.\nAutomated follow-up: Robotic telescopes capable of rapidly surveying large areas of the sky.\nMulti-Messenger Coordination: Collaboration with neutrino and cosmic ray observatories can provide additional information about GW sources.\nPopulation Synthesis Modeling: Using population synthesis models to predict the expected rate and characteristics of GW sources can help guide searches and interpret results.\nAddressing Systematic Errors: Careful characterization and mitigation of systematic errors in detector data is essential for ensuring the accuracy of results.\nDeep Learning: Utilizing deep learning techniques to filter noise and improve signal detection.\n\nI have tried to incorporate the key information from both reports and organize it in a way that is both comprehensive and accessible. Let me know if you have any other requests or would like me to focus on specific aspects of this topic.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nOkay, here's a consolidated summary of the key points regarding single-detector gravitational wave observations, drawing from both provided texts. I'll synthesize the information, focusing on challenges, strategies, and future prospects. I'll also highlight how the second text expands on the first.\n\nConsolidated Summary: Single-Detector Gravitational Wave Observations\n\nSingle-detector gravitational wave observations pose significant challenges but remain valuable and are increasingly sophisticated. Here’s a breakdown:\n\n1. Challenges of Single-Detector Observations:\n\nLocalization: The primary difficulty is poor localization of the source. Triangulation, which requires simultaneous detection by multiple detectors, is not possible. This makes follow-up observations (electromagnetic, neutrino) much harder.\nFalse Alarms: Single detectors are more susceptible to non-astrophysical noise sources (environmental disturbances, instrumental artifacts). Distinguishing genuine signals from noise is harder, leading to a higher false alarm rate.\nSky Coverage: Without multiple detectors, sensitivity is reduced and sky coverage is limited. Certain regions of the sky may be completely inaccessible.\n\n2. Strategies to Enhance Single-Detector Capabilities:\n\nImproved Noise Reduction: Ongoing efforts to reduce detector noise are crucial. This includes improvements in isolation, vibration control, and data analysis techniques.\nData Quality Vetting: Rigorous data quality checks and vetoes are essential to eliminate known noise sources and reduce false alarms.\nElectromagnetic Follow-Up: Rapid follow-up observations with electromagnetic telescopes (optical, radio, X-ray) are critical. The primary goal is to identify potential counterparts and confirm the astrophysical origin of the signal.\nMulti-Messenger Astronomy: Combining gravitational wave data with observations from other messengers (neutrinos, cosmic rays) can provide complementary information and improve confidence in detections.\nAdvanced Data Analysis: Sophisticated signal processing and machine learning techniques are used to search for weak signals buried in noise.\n\n3. Expanding on the First Text (Insights from the Second Text):\n\nGRB Localization: The second text focuses heavily on the strategies to use single-detector events to localize Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs). This is a particularly promising avenue.\nRapid Response: Emphasis on the necessity of extremely rapid response times for both gravitational wave detection and electromagnetic follow-up is crucial when looking for GRB counterparts.\nCoincident Searches: Searches for coincident events (gravitational waves and GRBs) within a short time window are used to identify potential associations.\nStatistical Methods: The second text highlights the use of advanced statistical methods (e.g. Bayesian inference) to estimate the probability of a true association, taking into account uncertainties in both the gravitational wave localization and the GRB position.\nSky Maps: Even with limited localization information, single-detector events can provide a rough sky map, which can be used to guide electromagnetic follow-up observations. The second text details how the quality of these sky maps is improving.\nPopulation Studies: Even without definitive localization, single-detector events can contribute to population studies of gravitational wave sources.\nImproved Localization using Advanced Techniques: The second text showcases methods utilizing signal-to-noise ratios and directional information to refine localization estimates.\n\n4. Future Prospects:\n\nThird-Generation Detectors: Future detectors (e.g., Cosmic Explorer, Einstein Telescope) will have significantly improved sensitivity and lower noise levels, making single-detector observations more reliable.\nGlobal Detector Network: Expanding the global network of gravitational wave detectors will reduce the need for single-detector observations.\nAdvanced Data Analysis Algorithms: The development of more sophisticated data analysis algorithms will further improve the detection of weak signals and reduce false alarm rates.\n\nIn summary, while single-detector observations are challenging, they remain a valuable tool for gravitational wave astronomy, especially in the context of multi-messenger searches and population studies.

Surrogate models are constructed through three steps: feature extraction, dimensionality reduction, and regression.\n\n## Construction of Surrogate Models\n\nSurrogate models are constructed by decomposing waveforms into simple-to-model data pieces, approximating each data piece with a low-dimensional vector space, and applying fitting and regression techniques to the low-dimensional representation over the parameter space. This approach enables fast evaluations for the modes, $h_{\\ell m}^S$, and can assemble the sum $h_S(t, $\\theta,$ \\phi) = \\sum_{\\ell=2}^{\\infty} \\sum_{m=-\\ell}^{\\ell} h_{\\ell m}^S(t; \\Lambda) \\,_{-2}Y_{\\ell $m}(\\theta,$ \\phi)$, where $_{-2}Y_{\\ell m}$ are the spin-$-2$ weighted spherical harmonics and $\\Lambda$ describes the model's parameterization.\n\n## Accuracy and Efficiency of Surrogate Models\n\nAn example gravitational wave prediction from a surrogate model compared with numerical relativity for a precessing binary black hole system is shown, where the numerical relativity simulation took $70,881$ CPU-hours ($\\approx1.75$ months using $56$ cores on the supercomputer Frontera), while the surrogate model can be evaluated in about $100$ milliseconds. The accuracy of surrogate model predictions can be increased by finer sampling of fiducial templates, which also allows for considerable speedup in waveform computation, particularly for low-mass and high-eccentricity compact binary systems.\n\n## Reduced-Order Modeling\n\nA singular value decomposition-based reduced-order method is presented for inspiral waveforms of non-spinning compact binaries evolving on eccentric orbits. The reduced-order model is designed to predict signals in the frequency band from $10$ Hz to $2$ kHz for aLIGO and aVirgo design sensitivity. The fractional amplitude and phase errors of surrogate model predictions are shown as a function of the resolution of the frequency grid.\n\n## Comparison of Waveform Models\n\nThe figure also illustrates cross sections of the amplitude and phase residuals as functions of $\\chi_1$ at three nodes $M_{Fj}$, with test-set waveforms generated for $51$ values of $\\chi_1$ and other parameters held constant at $\\{q, \\chi_2, \\Lambda_1, \\Lambda_2\\} = \\{0.6,0.2,2000,1000\\}$. The results show that different waveform models have varying levels of accuracy, with some models exhibiting biased results and disagreeing on the inferred binary parameters.\n\n## Incorporation of Model Accuracy in Gravitational Wave Bayesian Inference\n\nThe analysis focuses on the SXS:BBH:0926 numerical relativity simulation, a theoretical GW signal expected from general relativity, with a total mass of $100 M⊙$, mass ratio $1:2$, and large dimensionless spin magnitudes perpendicular to the orbital angular momentum for both black holes of $\\sim0.8$. The results show that all three techniques captured the true value of primary and secondary masses within the two-dimensional marginalized $90\\%$ credible interval.\n\n## Various Sampling Methods\n\nThe different curves in the figure represent various sampling methods, including tempered multifidelity importance sampling, reduced-order surrogate modeling, and others. These methods aim to improve the accuracy and efficiency of surrogate waveforms for gravitational waves.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the figure illustrates the fractional amplitude phase error in surrogate waveforms for gravitational waves, showcasing the accuracy and efficiency of surrogate models in approximating numerical relativity waveforms. The results highlight the importance of considering systematic biases in gravitational wave data analysis and the need for further research on waveform model development.\n\n## References\n\n* [Jonathan Blackman Thesis 2017](https://thesis.library.caltech.edu/10197/7/Jonathan_Blackman_Thesis_2017.pdf)\n* [arXiv:1812.08643](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.08643.pdf)\n* [JOSS: 10.21105/joss.07073](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.07073.pdf)\n* [Physical Review D: 10.1103/PhysRevD.110.104037](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.110.104037)\n* [PhD Thesis: Wigner University](https://wigner.hu/~barta/phd/phd_thesis.pdf)\n* [Physical Review D: 10.1103/PhysRevD.106.104025](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.106.104025)\n* [Nature: 10.1038/s41550-025-02579-7](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-025-02579-7)\n* [ScienceDirect: 10.1016/S1568494623007640](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1568494623007640)\n* [Physical Review X: 10.1103/PhysRevX.4.031006](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevX.4.031006)\n* [arXiv: 2310.03555v2](https://arxiv.org/html/2310.03555v2)", "marvel_standard_score": 6, "marvel_deepsearch_answer": "KEY_FACTS\n\nHere's a breakdown of the information from the provided text, focusing on key findings and the role of citations:\n\nKey Findings:\n\nWaveform Models Compared: The text discusses comparisons between different gravitational waveform models used to represent the signals produced by merging black holes.

This indicates a contradiction between the effective tidal deformability and the maximum mass observations, as a higher value of the speed of sound leads to a less severe contradiction.", "gpt4o_mini_answer": "The maximum mass of neutron stars, often referred to as the \"maximum mass limit,\" has been constrained by observations from the gravitational wave event GW170817, which was the merger of two neutron stars detected in August 2017. This event provided significant insights into the properties of neutron stars, particularly through the measurement of their tidal deformability.\n\nTidal deformability is a measure of how much a neutron star deforms in response to the tidal forces exerted by a companion star during a merger. The effective tidal deformability (\\(\\Lambda\\)) is influenced by the equation of state (EOS) of the neutron star matter, which in turn is related to the speed of sound in the neutron star's interior.\n\nFrom the analysis of GW170817, it was found that the tidal deformability of the neutron stars involved in the merger was relatively low, which implies that the maximum mass of neutron stars is constrained to be around 2.16 solar masses (\\(M_\\odot\\)) for the more massive star. This value is consistent with the upper limits derived from the tidal deformability measurements, which suggest that the speed of sound in neutron star matter cannot exceed the speed of light, in accordance with the principles of relativity.\n\nThe relationship between the maximum mass of neutron stars and the speed of sound is crucial. If the speed of sound in the neutron star matter were to approach the speed of light, it would imply a stiffer equation of state, allowing for more massive neutron stars. However, the constraints from GW170817 indicate that the speed of sound in neutron star matter is likely significantly less than the speed of light, which leads to a softer equation of state and consequently a lower maximum mass.\n\nIn summary, the maximum mass of neutron stars is constrained to about 2.16 \\(M_\\odot\\) based on the GW170817 event, and this is closely related to the effective tidal deformability and the speed of sound in neutron star matter, which must remain below the speed of light to satisfy relativistic principles.", "gpt4o_mini_score": 7, "marvel_standard_answer": "<QUERY> What is the maximum mass of neutron stars according to the constraints derived from the GW170817 event, and how does it relate to the speed of sound in the context of effective tidal deformability?. Today is2025-08-15'. </QUERY>\n\nThe maximum mass of neutron stars has been a subject of extensive study, particularly in the context of the GW170817 event. This event, detected by the LIGO-Virgo collaboration, has provided significant insights into the properties of neutron stars, including their maximum mass and the speed of sound within them.\n\nAccording to various analyses of the GW170817 event, the maximum mass of a non-rotating neutron star ($M_{\\rm TOV}$) is constrained to be:\n\n- Less than $2.3 M_{\\odot}$ (Documents 4 and 6)\n- Around $2.1-2.4 M_{\\odot}$ (Document 12)\n- Specifically, $M_{\\rm TOV} < 2.09^{+0.11}_{-0.09}(^{+0.06}_{-0.04}) M_{\\odot}$ at the $2\\sigma(1\\sigma)$ level if the merger product is a black hole after a brief hypermassive neutron star (HMNS) phase (Document 9)\n\nThe speed of sound ($c_s$) in neutron stars is related to the equation of state (EOS), which describes the pressure ($P$) and energy density ($\\epsilon$) of the neutron star matter. The speed of sound squared is given by $c_s^2 = \\frac{dP}{d\\epsilon}$. The conformal limit, where $c_s^2 = \\frac{1}{3}$, is a critical reference point.\n\nThe effective tidal deformability ($\\tilde{\\Lambda}$) is a measure of how easily a neutron star can be deformed by an external tidal field. It is related to the Love number ($k_2$) and the radius ($R$) and mass ($M$) of the neutron star. The $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ is crucial in understanding the neutron star's response to tidal forces during mergers like GW170817.\n\nThe relationship between the maximum mass of neutron stars, the speed of sound, and the effective tidal deformability is intricate and depends on the neutron star's equation of state. Stiffer equations of state, which result in larger maximum masses, often imply a speed of sound that approaches the speed of light ($c$) at high densities. Conversely, softer equations of state, which suggest lower maximum masses, may have a speed of sound that is closer to the conformal limit ($\\frac{c}{\\sqrt{3}}$) at certain densities.\n\nGiven these considerations, the maximum mass of neutron stars, as constrained by the GW170817 event, appears to be around $2.1-2.4 M_{\\odot}$. The speed of sound in neutron stars, in the context of effective tidal deformability, likely approaches a significant fraction of the speed of light, especially at high densities, but can be constrained further with more precise measurements and detailed analyses of neutron star properties.\n\n<ANSWER> The maximum mass of neutron stars, as constrained by the GW170817 event, is in the range of $2.1-2.4 M_{\\odot}$. The speed of sound in neutron stars, related to the effective tidal deformability, likely approaches a significant fraction of the speed of light, especially at high densities. These constraints are derived from analyses of the GW170817 event and other astrophysical observations, and they have implications for our understanding of the neutron star equation of state. </ANSWER>\n\n# Maximum Mass of Neutron Stars and Its Relation to the Speed of Sound in the Context of Effective Tidal Deformability\n\nThe maximum mass of neutron stars has been a topic of interest in astrophysics, particularly after the detection of the binary neutron star merger event GW170817 by the LIGO-Virgo collaboration. This event has provided significant constraints on the properties of neutron stars, including their radii, tidal deformability, and maximum mass.\n\n## Constraints on Maximum Mass from GW170817\n\nThe analysis of the GW170817 event suggests that the maximum mass of cold spherical neutron stars can be weakly constrained as $M_{max} \\lesssim 2.3 M_{\\odot}$ [1, 2]. However, more recent studies have provided tighter constraints, with the maximum mass of a non-spinning neutron star, $M_{\\rm TOV}$, constrained to be ${M}\\_{\\mathrm{TOV}}\\lt {2.09}\\_{-0.09}^{+0.11}{(}\\_{-0.04}^{+0.06}){M}\\_{\\odot }$ at the $2\\sigma$ ($1\\sigma$) level if the merger product is a black hole after a brief hypermassive neutron star (HMNS) phase [3]. For the supramassive neutron star (SMNS) case, the constraint is ${2.09}\\_{-0.09}^{+0.11}{(}\\_{-0.04}^{+0.06}{M}\\_{\\odot })\\leqslant {M}\\_{\\mathrm{TOV}}\\lt {2.43}\\_{-0.08}^{+0.10}{(}\\_{-0.04}^{+0.06}){M}\\_{\\odot }$ [3].\n\n## Relation to Speed of Sound and Effective Tidal Deformability\n\nThe speed of sound $c_s$ in dense nuclear matter is related to the equation of state and can be expressed as $c_s = \\sqrt{\\frac{dp}{d\\epsilon}}$, where $p$ is the pressure and $\\epsilon$ is the energy density [4]. The effective tidal deformability $\\Lambda$ is related to the speed of sound and can be used to constrain the equation of state. Studies have shown that the tidal deformability of a $1.4M_\\odot$ neutron star is less than $600$, suggesting that the sound speed in the cores of neutron stars is likely larger than the conformal limit of $c/\\sqrt{3}$ [5].\n\n## Insights from Recent Studies\n\nRecent studies have provided further insights into the relationship between the maximum mass of neutron stars and the speed of sound in the context of effective tidal deformability. For example, [6] found that the maximum mass of neutron stars with a quark core is constrained to have an absolute upper bound around $2.85 M_{\\odot}$ at the $90\\%$ posterior credible level. Additionally, [7] discussed the constraints on the neutron star equation of state, including the speed of sound, using a parametrized density-dependent speed of sound approach.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the maximum mass of neutron stars is constrained by the GW170817 event to be in the range $M_{max}^{sph} \\sim 2.1-2.4 M_{\\odot}$ [8].

This relationship is important for understanding the characteristics of the gravitational waves emitted during the inspiral, merger, and ringdown phases of binary black hole or neutron star systems.\n\n1. **Maximum Frequency in Signals**: The maximum frequency of the gravitational wave signal is determined by the dynamics of the binary system. As the two compact objects spiral inwards due to gravitational radiation, the frequency of the emitted gravitational waves increases. The maximum frequency corresponds to the point just before the merger, where the two objects are very close together and the gravitational waves reach their highest frequency.\n\n2. **High Frequency Estimate \\( f_{m \\text{ high}} \\)**: The high frequency estimate \\( f_{m \\text{ high}} \\) is a theoretical upper limit on the frequency of the gravitational waves emitted by the binary system. It is often set based on the properties of the binary components, such as their masses and spins, and is typically associated with the merger phase of the binary. For equal-mass binaries, this frequency can be estimated using numerical relativity simulations or analytical models that describe the dynamics of the merger.\n\n3. **Relationship**: The choice of \\( f_{m \\text{ high}} \\) directly influences the analysis of the gravitational wave signal. If \\( f_{m \\text{ high}} \\) is set too low, important high-frequency information from the merger phase may be lost, leading to an incomplete understanding of the system's parameters. Conversely, if it is set too high, it may include frequencies that are not physically relevant or that exceed the capabilities of the detection instruments.\n\n4. **Signal Analysis**: In signal processing and data analysis, the maximum frequency analyzed must be consistent with the expected \\( f_{m \\text{ high}} \\). This ensures that the analysis captures the full dynamics of the binary system, particularly during the critical merger phase, where the frequency can rise sharply. The choice of \\( f_{m \\text{ high}} \\) thus helps define the bandwidth of the signal that needs to be analyzed to extract accurate astrophysical parameters, such as the masses and spins of the binary components.\n\nIn summary, the maximum frequency analyzed in gravitational wave signals from equal-mass binaries is intrinsically linked to the choice of the high frequency estimate \\( f_{m \\text{ high}} \\).

The condition called dark fringe in a symmetric Michelson interferometer occurs when the path difference between the two beams is an odd multiple of half-wavelengths.\n\n## What is a Dark Fringe?\n\nIn a symmetric Michelson interferometer, a dark fringe occurs when the path difference between two waves is $(m + \\frac{1}{2})\\lambda$, leading to destructive interference. This condition is met when the arm length difference is set to $\\delta l/\\lambda=0.25$, which corresponds to $(m + \\frac{1}{2})\\lambda$ when $m=0$ [1](https://lo-amrt.vlabs.ac.in/exp/michelsons-interferometer-wavelength/theory.html).\n\n## Significance of Dark Fringe\n\nThe significance of the condition called dark fringe in a symmetric Michelson interferometer when the arm length difference is set to $\\delta l/\\lambda=0.25$ can be understood by analyzing the interferometer's output signal. The power in the South port of a symmetric Michelson interferometer as a function of the arm length difference $\\Delta L$ is given by $S = {E_S}E_S^{\\ast} = {P_0}{\\cos ^2}(k\\Delta L) = {P_0}{\\cos ^2}(2\\pi \\Delta L/\\lambda)$ [2](https://link.springer.com/article/10.12942/lrr-2010-1).\n\nThe tuning at which the output power drops to zero is called the dark fringe.

The condition called dark fringe in a symmetric Michelson interferometer occurs when the path difference between the two beams is an odd multiple of half-wavelengths.\n\nWhat is a Dark Fringe?\n\nIn a symmetric Michelson interferometer, a dark fringe occurs when the path difference between two waves is \n(\n𝑚\n+\n1\n2\n)\n𝜆\n(m+\n2\n1\n\t​\n\n)λ, leading to destructive interference. This condition is met when the arm length difference is set to \n𝛿\n𝑙\n/\n𝜆\n=\n0.25\nδl/λ=0.25, which corresponds to \n(\n𝑚\n+\n1\n2\n)\n𝜆\n(m+\n2\n1\n\t​\n\n)λ when \n𝑚\n=\n0\nm=0.\n\nSignificance of Dark Fringe\n\nThe significance of the condition called dark fringe in a symmetric Michelson interferometer when the arm length difference is set to \n𝛿\n𝑙\n/\n𝜆\n=\n0.25\nδl/λ=0.25 can be understood by analyzing the interferometer's output signal. The power in the South port of a symmetric Michelson interferometer as a function of the arm length difference \nΔ\n𝐿\nΔL is given by \n𝑆\n=\n𝐸\n𝑆\n𝐸\n𝑆\n∗\n=\n𝑃\n0\ncos\n⁡\n2\n(\n𝑘\nΔ\n𝐿\n)\n=\n𝑃\n0\ncos\n⁡\n2\n(\n2\n𝜋\nΔ\n𝐿\n/\n𝜆\n)\nS=E\nS\n\t​\n\nE\nS\n∗\n\t​\n\n=P\n0\n\t​\n\ncos\n2\n(kΔL)=P\n0\n\t​\n\ncos\n2\n(2πΔL/λ).\n\nThe tuning at which the output power drops to zero is called the dark fringe. Current interferometric gravitational-wave detectors operate their Michelson interferometer at or near the dark fringe. A macroscopic arm-length difference plays no role in the Michelson output signal for a monochromatic laser beam with infinite coherence length. However, in real interferometers, care must be taken that the arm-length difference is well below the coherence length of the light source.\n\nImpact of Phase Shift on Interference Pattern\n\nA phase shift corresponding to \n𝛿\n𝑙\n/\n𝜆\n=\n0.25\nδl/λ=0.25 impacts the interference pattern in a symmetric Michelson interferometer. This phase shift can be expressed as \n𝜙\n=\n2\n𝜋\n𝛿\n𝑙\n/\n𝜆\n=\n2\n𝜋\n⋅\n0.25\n=\n𝜋\n2\nϕ=2πδl/λ=2π⋅0.25=\n2\nπ\n\t​\n\n. The interference pattern in a symmetric Michelson interferometer can be described by the equation \n𝐼\n=\n2\n𝐼\n0\ncos\n⁡\n2\n(\n𝜙\n/\n2\n)\nI=2I\n0\n\t​\n\ncos\n2\n(ϕ/2), where \n𝐼\n0\nI\n0\n\t​\n\n is the intensity of each beam and \n𝜙\nϕ is the phase difference. For a phase shift of \n𝜋\n2\n2\nπ\n\t​\n\n, the intensity becomes \n𝐼\n=\n2\n𝐼\n0\ncos\n⁡\n2\n(\n𝜋\n4\n)\n=\n𝐼\n0\nI=2I\n0\n\t​\n\ncos\n2\n(\n4\nπ\n\t​\n\n)=I\n0\n\t​\n\n.\n\nSensitivity to Small Changes in Arm Length\n\nOperating a Michelson interferometer at a dark fringe implies that small changes in arm length can be detected with high sensitivity. When the interferometer is operated at a dark fringe, small changes in arm length can cause significant changes in the interference pattern.\n\nThe implications of operating a Michelson interferometer at a dark fringe in terms of sensitivity to small changes in arm length are that it enables the detection of minute displacements that are accurate to a fraction of a wavelength. When operated at a dark fringe, the interferometer is highly sensitive to small changes in arm length, allowing for the measurement of changes as small as \nΔ\n𝐿\n=\n𝜆\nΔL=λ, where \n𝜆\nλ is the wavelength of the incident light.\n\nPractical Applications\n\nOperating a Michelson interferometer at a dark fringe with \n𝛿\n𝑙\n/\n𝜆\n=\n0.25\nδl/λ=0.25 has several practical applications in precision measurement fields. The dark fringe operating point is given by \nΔ\n𝐿\n/\n𝜆\n=\n(\n2\n𝑁\n+\n1\n)\n⋅\n0.25\nΔL/λ=(2N+1)⋅0.25 with \n𝑁\nN a non-negative integer. This operating point has several advantages, the most important being the low (ideally zero) light power on the diode, allowing the Michelson interferometer to be used as a null instrument or null measurement, which generally is a good method to reduce systematic errors.\n\nSome of the practical applications of the Michelson interferometer include:\n\nPrecise distance measurements\nMeasuring the refractive index of a gas\nInterferometer Techniques for Gravitational-Wave Detection\nApplication in Gravitational Wave Detection\n\nThe condition \n𝛿\n𝑙\n/\n𝜆\n=\n0.25\nδl/λ=0.25 corresponds to a specific phase shift between the light fields in the two arms of the interferometer. If a gravitational wave slightly changes the lengths of the two arms, the fringe pattern will change, and so by monitoring the changes of the fringe pattern one can detect the gravitational wave.\n\nEffect on Sensitivity\n\nThe condition \n𝛿\n𝑙\n/\n𝜆\n=\n0.25\nδl/λ=0.25 affects the sensitivity of a symmetric Michelson interferometer to changes in arm length by altering the interference pattern. Specifically, it corresponds to a transition from a dark fringe to a light circle fringe as one mirror is moved, which impacts the interferometer's sensitivity to arm length changes.\n\nThe Implications of Arm Length Difference on Michelson Interferometer Sensitivity\n\nThe Michelson interferometer is a precision instrument used to produce interference fringes by splitting a light beam into two parts and then recombining them after they have traveled different optical paths. Operating the interferometer at a dark fringe has significant implications for its sensitivity to small changes in arm length.\n\nUnderstanding the Impact of Arm Length Difference\n\nThe implications of the arm length difference \n𝛿\n𝑙\n/\n𝜆\n=\n0.25\nδl/λ=0.25 on the Michelson interferometer's sensitivity to minute changes in optical path lengths can be understood by considering the relative strength of the sidebands on the DP, which can be altered by changing the small Michelson arm length difference \n𝛿\n𝑙\nδl over a fraction of a wavelength.\n\nMathematical Representation\n\nThe intensity equation \n𝐼\n(\nΔ\n𝐿\n)\n∼\n1\n+\n[\n𝛾\n(\nΔ\n𝐿\n)\n+\n0.25\ncos\n⁡\n(\nΔ\n𝑘\nΔ\n𝐿\n)\n]\nI(ΔL)∼1+[γ(ΔL)+0.25cos(ΔkΔL)], where \nΔ\n𝐿\nΔL is the optical path difference, \n𝛾\n(\nΔ\n𝐿\n)\nγ(ΔL) is a function of \nΔ\n𝐿\nΔL, and \nΔ\n𝑘\nΔk is the difference in wave numbers of the reflected beams, provides further insight into the relationship between arm length difference and sensitivity.\n\nExperimental Considerations\n\nIn practice, achieving the required precision in arm lengths is challenging. For instance, Albert Michelson, who used such interferometers, faced challenges in machining arms to the required precision.\n\nOptimization and Applications\n\nOptimizing the PMF length difference between the two arms of a Michelson interferometer from 0.1 m to 0.03 m results in an ultrahigh sensitivity increase. The sensitivity of the Michelson interferometer to minute changes in optical path lengths is also influenced by the angle \n𝜙\nϕ between the ends of the arms.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the condition called dark fringe in a symmetric Michelson interferometer when the arm length difference is set to \n𝛿\n𝑙\n/\n𝜆\n=\n0.25\nδl/λ=0.25 is significant in understanding the interferometer's output signal and its application in detecting gravitational waves. The phase shift corresponding to \n𝛿\n𝑙\n/\n𝜆\n=\n0.25\nδl/λ=0.25 impacts the interference pattern, resulting in a change in the fringe pattern.\n\nReferences\n1 https://lo-amrt.vlabs.ac.in/exp/michelsons-interferometer-wavelength/theory.html\n2 https://link.springer.com/article/10.12942/lrr-2010-1\n3 https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/michelson-interferometer\n4 https://dcc.ligo.org/LIGO-P1500233-v1/public.pdf\n5 https://w.astro.berkeley.edu/~jrg/ngst/michelson.html\n6 https://pressbooks.online.ucf.edu/osuniversityphysics3/chapter/the-michelson-interferometer/\n7 https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-dark-fringe-in-the-Michelson-interferometer-How-would-you-explain-it\n8 https://www.quora.com/Why-is-the-central-fringe-dark-in-a-Michelson-interferometer\n9 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41114-016-0002-8\n10 http://homepage.physics.uiowa.edu/~fskiff/Physics_132/New+Lab+Manual/int_lab_man/pdfs/B1_Michelson_v5.pdf\nThe Michelson Interferometer\nPhase Difference in Michelson Interferometer\nMichelson Interferometer\nPhase-Shifting Interferometry\nhttps://advlabs.aapt.org/tcal/files/BriefIntro_ModernInterferometry.pdf\nhttps://research.vu.nl/files/95269005/679278.pdf\nhttps://www.cis.rit.edu/class/simg232/lab8-20033-michelson.pdf\n\n</FINAL_DETAILED_REPORT>", "marvel_deepsearch_score": 9, "evaluation_model_type": "openai", "evaluation_model_name": "gpt-4o-mini", "qa_model_type": "openai", "qa_model_name": "gpt-4o-mini", "gpt4o_mini_answer_relevancy": 0.95, "gpt4o_mini_answer_correctness": 0.85, "gpt4o_mini_faithfulness": 0.95, "marvel_standard_answer_relevancy": 0.98, "marvel_standard_answer_correctness": 0.95, "marvel_standard_faithfulness": 0.95, "marvel_deepsearch_answer_relevancy": 0.92, "marvel_deepsearch_answer_correctness": 0.9, "marvel_deepsearch_faithfulness": 0.98}

Each experiment has its own strengths and limitations, and together they aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of gravitational waves and their role in the Universe.\n\n## References\n--------------\n\n*   [https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/1146649](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/1146649)\n*   [https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-02003-6](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-02003-6)\n*   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIGO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIGO)\n*   [https://news.ucr.edu/articles/2025/02/14/new-technology-enhances-gravitational-wave-detection](https://news.ucr.edu/articles/2025/02/14/new-technology-enhances-gravitational-wave-detection)\n*   [https://cds.cern.ch/record/454173/files/p301.pdf](https://cds.cern.ch/record/454173/files/p301.pdf)\n*   [https://arxiv.org/html/2312.17291v1](https://arxiv.org/html/2312.17291v1)\n*   [https://www.einstein-online.info/en/spotlight/3-generation-gw-detectors/](https://www.einstein-online.info/en/spotlight/3-generation-gw-detectors/)\n*   [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-35670-y](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-35670-y)\n*   [https://www.universetoday.com/articles/magnets-could-become-the-next-generation-of-gravitational-wave-detectors](https://www.universetoday.com/articles/magnets-could-become-the-next-generation-of-gravitational-wave-detectors)", "marvel_standard_score": 8, "marvel_deepsearch_answer": "KEY_FACTS\n[\n  \"https://www.ctc.cam.ac.uk/research/high-frequency-gravitational-waves\",\n  \"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-08668-x\",\n  \"https://phys.org/news/2022-02-opportunities-high-frequency-gravitational.html\",\n  \"https://moriond.in2p3.fr/2024/Cosmology/transparencies/6_saturday/1_morning/03_Domcke.pdf\",\n  \"https://inspirehep.net/literature/634937\",\n  \"https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20120002551/downloads/20120002551.pdf\",\n  \"https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.109.103538\",\n  \"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjc/s10052-025-14158-1\",\n  \"https://inspirehep.net/literature/652873\",\n  \"https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11723\",\n  \"http://cds.cern.ch/record/2922204\",\n  \"https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.109.083001\",\n  \"https://inspirehep.net/literature/2871027\",\n  \"https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.129.041101\",\n  \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEDZvz8qnhs\",\n  \"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/2081/1/012009\"\n]\nFINER_DETAILS\n[\n  \"https://www.ctc.cam.ac.uk/research/high-frequency-gravitational-waves\",\n  \"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-08668-x\",\n  \"https://phys.org/news/2022-02-opportunities-high-frequency-gravitational.html\",\n  \"https://moriond.in2p3.fr/2024/Cosmology/transparencies/6_saturday/1_morning/03_Domcke.pdf\",\n  \"https://inspirehep.net/literature/634937\",\n  \"https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20120002551/downloads/20120002551.pdf\",\n  \"https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.109.103538\",\n  \"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjc/s10052-025-14158-1\",\n  \"https://inspirehep.net/literature/652873\",\n  \"https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11723\",\n  \"http://cds.cern.ch/record/2922204\",\n  \"https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.109.083001\",\n  \"https://inspirehep.net/literature/2871027\",\n  \"https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.129.041101\",\n  \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEDZvz8qnhs\",\n  \"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/2081/1/012009\"\n]\nSUMMARY\n[\n  \"https://www.ctc.cam.ac.uk/research/projects/high-frequency-gravitational-waves\",\n  \"https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06477\",\n  \"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-08668-x\",\n  \"https://phys.org/news/2022-02-opportunities-high-frequency-gravitational.html\",\n  \"https://moriond.in2p3.fr/2024/Cosmology/transparencies/6_saturday/1_morning/03_Domcke.pdf\",\n  \"https://inspirehep.net/literature/634937\",\n  \"https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20120002551/downloads/20120002551.pdf\",\n  \"https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.109.103538.pdf\",\n  \"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjc/s10052-025-14158-1\",\n  \"https://inspirehep.net/literature/652873\",\n  \"https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11723.pdf\",\n  \"http://cds.cern.ch/record/2922204\",\n  \"https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.109.083001.pdf\",\n  \"https://inspirehep.net/literature/2871027.pdf\",\n  \"https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.129.041101.pdf\",\n  \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEDZvz8qnhs\",\n  \"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/2081/1/012009/pdf\"\n]\nREFERENCES\n\nHere's a cleaned-up list of citations, removing duplicates and extraneous characters like trailing &gt;

Here are the key characteristics and significance of GW190814, along with details about the electromagnetic follow-ups conducted:\n\n### Characteristics of GW190814:\n\n1. **Masses**: The event involved a black hole with a mass of approximately 22.2 solar masses and a neutron star with a mass of about 2.6 solar masses. This mass ratio is particularly interesting because it suggests that the neutron star is among the heaviest known, challenging existing models of neutron star formation and stability.\n\n2. **Detection**: GW190814 was detected by the LIGO and Virgo gravitational wave observatories, which identified the gravitational waves produced by the merger. The signal was strong and clear, allowing for precise measurements of the event's parameters.\n\n3. **Type of Merger**: This event is classified as a black hole-neutron star merger, which is a relatively rare occurrence compared to black hole-black hole or neutron star-neutron star mergers. The combination of a black hole and a neutron star provides unique insights into the properties of both types of compact objects.\n\n### Significance of GW190814:\n\n1. **Neutron Star Mass Limits**: The detection of a neutron star with a mass of 2.6 solar masses raises questions about the maximum mass limit for neutron stars, which is still a topic of active research. This event suggests that neutron stars can exist at higher masses than previously thought, potentially influencing our understanding of the equation of state of nuclear matter.\n\n2. **Formation Scenarios**: The mass of the black hole and the neutron star suggests that they may have formed through different evolutionary paths. This event provides valuable data for models of stellar evolution, supernova mechanisms, and the formation of compact binaries.\n\n3. **Astrophysical Implications**: The merger contributes to our understanding of the population of black holes and neutron stars in the universe, as well as the processes that lead to their formation and eventual mergers.\n\n### Electromagnetic Follow-ups:\n\nDespite the significant gravitational wave signal, the electromagnetic follow-up observations for GW190814 were limited. Here are some key points regarding the follow-ups:\n\n1. **Lack of Electromagnetic Counterpart**: Unlike some other gravitational wave events, such as GW170817 (a neutron star-neutron star merger), GW190814 did not have a confirmed electromagnetic counterpart detected across various wavelengths (optical, X-ray, gamma-ray). This absence raises questions about the nature of the merger and the conditions under which electromagnetic emissions are produced.\n\n2. **Observational Campaigns**: Various observatories, including ground-based telescopes and space-based observatories, conducted follow-up observations in the days and weeks following the detection. These included searches for optical transients, gamma-ray bursts, and other potential signals that could indicate the presence of an electromagnetic counterpart.\n\n3. **Implications for Future Observations**: The lack of an electromagnetic counterpart for GW190814 suggests that not all black hole-neutron star mergers produce observable electromagnetic signals, or that the conditions for such emissions may be more complex than previously understood. This finding emphasizes the need for continued multi-messenger astronomy efforts to better understand the nature of these events.\n\nIn summary, GW190814 is a landmark event in the study of black hole-neutron star mergers, providing critical insights into the properties of compact objects and the dynamics of their mergers, while also highlighting the challenges in detecting electromagnetic counterparts associated with such events.", "gpt4o_mini_score": 9, "marvel_standard_answer": "\nThe GW190814 event, detected on August 14, 2019, involved a 23 solar mass black hole and a 2.6 solar mass compact object.

The compact object's mass falls within a range where it could be either a neutron star or a black hole, making GW190814 a potential neutron star-black hole binary or the smallest black hole ever found [@\"url:https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/abdaae\"]. The merger's source is localized to a distance of ~240 Mpc, with a luminosity distance estimated as \n𝑑\n𝐿\n=\n267\n±\n27\nd\nL\n\t​\n\n=267±27 Mpc [@\"url:https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ab960f\"].\n\nExtensive electromagnetic follow-up observations were conducted across the electromagnetic spectrum, including observations using the MeerLICHT telescope, the Dark Energy Camera (DECam), and other facilities [@\"url:https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.12611\"]. The lack of detected electromagnetic counterparts provides insights into the properties of the merger and the environment around it [@\"url:https://inspirehep.net/literature/1806560.pdf\"]. The non-detection of electromagnetic counterparts suggests that the merger may have involved two black holes, or a black hole and a neutron star with the neutron star being swallowed whole by the black hole [@\"url:https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.125.261104\"].\n\nSeveral observational challenges and limitations contributed to the non-detection of electromagnetic counterparts in the GW190814 event. The event was six times farther away than the merger observed in 2017 (GW170817), making it harder to pick up any light signals. Additionally, the large distances and sky-areas of the events made it difficult to detect electromagnetic counterparts. The full moon during the days immediately following the GW detection also adversely affected the effective depth of observations. The mass ratio of the merger was extremely unequal, with a component about 23 times the mass of the Sun and one about 2.6 solar masses. This unequal mass ratio likely resulted in weaker tidal effects, making it less probable for the less massive component (potentially a neutron star) to produce a detectable electromagnetic counterpart before being consumed by the more massive black hole.\n\nThe merger rate density for GW190814-like systems is estimated to be \n𝑅\n=\n1.\n7\n−\n1.3\n+\n3.6\n×\n10\n−\n2\nR=1.7\n−1.3\n+3.6\n\t​\n\n×10\n−2\n Mpc\n−\n3\n−3\nyr\n−\n1\n−1\n [@\"url:https://www.ligo-india.in/outreach/detections/gw190814/\"]. The maximum neutron star mass is estimated to be below \n2.2\n2.2 or \n2.3\n2.3 solar masses from GW170817, \n2.4\n2.4 solar masses from short gamma-ray bursts, and between \n2\n2 and \n3\n3 solar masses from the observed population [@\"url:https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021Symm...13..183K/abstract\"]. The characteristics of the GW190814 event, including the mass ratio and the lack of electromagnetic counterparts, provide constraints on the neutron star equation of state, particularly in the context of heavy neutron stars [@\"url:https://www.researchgate.net/publication/348092007_Neutron_Star_Equation_of_State_in_Light_of_GW190814\"].\n\nA search for the radio counterpart to the possible neutron star-black hole merger GW190814 was conducted using the Australian Square Kilometre Array [@\"url:https://www.researchgate.net/publication/363195537_A_comprehensive_search_for_the_radio_counterpart_of_GW190814_with_the_Australian_Square_Kilometre_Array_Pathfinder.pdf\"]. The observations allow for the placement of deep constraints on the existence of a radio afterglow from a highly off-axis relativistic jet launched during the merger [@\"url:https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11982926\"]. The non-detection of electromagnetic counterparts to the GW190814 event implies that the merger is likely a plunging event, and hence no kilonova signal is expected [@\"url:https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1822425\"]. The posterior distributions of GW190814 show that it must be a plunging event [@\"url:https://dcc.ligo.org/public/0166/P190814/010/FinalAcceptedVersion.pdf\"].\n\nThe GW190814 event has significant implications for our understanding of neutron star-black hole mergers and the formation of compact objects in binary systems. The event suggests that mergers of this kind are expected to occur much less frequently than the more typical mergers of two black holes or two neutron stars. The observation of GW190814 has the potential to improve our understanding of the supranuclear equation of state. The event's compact-binary source is atypical, characterized by highly asymmetric masses and a lower-mass component that lies between the heaviest known neutron star and black hole masses.\n\nThe non-detection of electromagnetic counterparts has implications for models of kilonovae and SGRB afterglows.

This event involved a 23 solar mass black hole and a 2.6 solar mass compact object, which could be either the heaviest known neutron star or the lightest known black hole.\n\nThe characteristics of GW190814 include a compact object binary coalescence with a mass ratio of ~9:1, consisting of a 23 solar mass black hole and a 2.6 solar mass compact object. The compact object's mass falls within a range where it could be either a neutron star or a black hole, making GW190814 a potential neutron star-black hole binary or the smallest black hole ever found. The merger's source is localized to a distance of ~240 Mpc, with a luminosity distance estimated as d_L = 267 ± 27 Mpc.\n\nThe significance of GW190814 lies in its implications for understanding the properties of neutron star matter, black hole formation, and the equation of state of neutron stars. The event's sky localization shows a tight localization area, and electromagnetic follow-ups were conducted but did not yield any counterparts. The merger rate density for GW190814-like systems is estimated to be R = 1.7^{+3.6}_{-1.3} × 10^{-2} Mpc^{-3}yr^{-1}.\n\nExtensive electromagnetic follow-up observations were conducted across the electromagnetic spectrum, but no counterparts were identified. These follow-ups included observations using the MeerLICHT telescope, the Dark Energy Camera (DECam), and other facilities. The lack of detected electromagnetic counterparts provides insights into the properties of the merger and the environment around it.\n\nSeveral observational challenges and limitations contributed to the non-detection of electromagnetic counterparts in the GW190814 event. The event was six times farther away than the merger observed in 2017 (GW170817), making it harder to pick up any light signals. Additionally, the large distances and sky-areas of the events made it difficult to detect electromagnetic counterparts. The full moon during the days immediately following the GW detection also adversely affected the effective depth of observations.\n\nThe non-detection of electromagnetic counterparts suggests that the merger may have involved two black holes, or a black hole and a neutron star with the neutron star being swallowed whole by the black hole.\n\nReferences:\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2103.02399.pdf\nhttps://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/abdaae\nhttps://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ab960f\nhttps://cplberry.com/2020/06/23/gw190814/\nhttps://www.aei.mpg.de/329361/GW190814_Science_Summary.pdf\nhttps://www.ligo-india.in/outreach/detections/gw190814/\nhttps://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2021/05/aa40231-20/aa40231-20.html\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2102.08957.pdf\n[@\"url:https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2021/05/aa40231-20/aa40231-20.html\",\"url:https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2021/05/aa40231-20/aa40231-20.html&gt\",\"url:https://www.aei.mpg.de/329361/GW190814_Science_Summary.pdf\",\"url:https://www.aei.mpg.de/329361/GW190814_Science_Summary.pdf&gt\",\"url:https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.08957.pdf\",\"url:https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.08957&gt\",\"url:https://cplberry.com/2020/06/23/gw190814\",\"url:https://cplberry.com/2020/06/23/gw190814/&gt\",\"url:https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.04998\",\"url:https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.04998&gt\",\"url:https://carnegiescience.edu/gravity-collective-search-electromagnetic-counterpart-neutron-star-black-hole-merger-gw190814\",\"url:https://carnegiescience.edu/gravity-collective-search-electromagnetic-counterpart-neutron-star-black-hole-merger-gw190814&gt\",\"url:https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/news/ligo20200623&gt\",\"url:https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/510/3/3794/6461098\",\"url:https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/510/3/3794/6461098&gt\"]

This catalogue is the result of observations from 2015 to 2020, encompassing the first through third observing runs (O1, O2, O3a, and O3b) of Advanced LIGO and Virgo.\n\n## Compact-Binary Mergers\nGWTC-3 confirms that compact-binary mergers, including binary black hole (BBH), binary neutron star (BNS), and neutron star-black hole (NSBH) mergers, occur in the universe. The catalogue contains signals consistent with three classes of binary mergers: BBH, BNS, and NSBH mergers [1]. The binary neutron star merger rate is inferred to be between $10$ and $1700$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$, and the neutron star-black hole merger rate is between $7.8$ and $140$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ [2].\n\n## Properties of Merging Compact Binaries\nThe population of merging compact binaries includes BBH, BNS, and NSBH mergers. A total of 76 compact binary mergers were detected with gravitational waves below a false alarm rate of 1 per year [3]. The binary black hole merger rate is inferred to be between $17.9$ and $44$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ at a fiducial redshift ($z=0.2$) [2]. The rate of binary black hole mergers is observed to increase with redshift at a rate proportional to $(1+z)^{\\kappa}$ with $\\kappa=2.9_{-1.8}^{+1.7}$ for $z\\lesssim1$.\n\n## Neutron Star Mass Distribution\nThe neutron star mass distribution is broad and relatively flat, extending from $1.2_{-0.2}^{+0.1}$ to $2.0_{-0.3}^{+0.3}M_{\\odot}$ [2].\n\n## Occurrence in Star Clusters\nThe detections have implications on all source categories, including self-consistent per-source category rates that account for ambiguity in some events' source classifications. The catalogue also puts constraints on a potential mass gap between NS and BH, and compares the inferred neutron star mass distribution to the galactic sample [1]. The observations confirm the occurrence of compact-binary mergers in star clusters, with environments such as nuclear star clusters or active galactic nuclei favoring dense and massive systems with deep potential wells [4].\n\n## Eccentricity and Star Cluster Mergers\nThe third gravitational-wave transient catalogue (GWTC-3) shows support for eccentricity $≳0.1$ at $10$ Hz, and their results indicate that densely populated star clusters may produce the majority of the observed mergers [5].\n\n## Conclusion\nIn conclusion, GWTC-3 provides a comprehensive update on the searches for gravitational waves from compact binary coalescences, including binary black hole and neutron star mergers. The catalogue confirms the occurrence of compact-binary mergers in the universe and provides new insights into their properties and occurrence in star clusters.\n\n## References\n[1] [https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.03634.pdf](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.03634.pdf)\n[2] [https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevX.13.041039](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevX.13.041039)\n[3] [https://dcc.ligo.org/LIGO-P2100239/public](https://dcc.ligo.org/LIGO-P2100239/public)\n[4] [https://arxiv.org/html/2508.09965v1](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.09965v1)\n[5] [https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/522/1/466/7100970](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/522/1/466/7100970)\n\n</ARTICLE>", "marvel_standard_score": 8, "marvel_deepsearch_answer": "The third gravitational-wave transient catalogue (GWTC-3) confirms that compact-binary mergers, including binary black hole, binary neutron star, and neutron star-black hole mergers, occur in the universe and provides evidence that these mergers can occur in star clusters, particularly in dense and massive systems with deep potential wells such as nuclear star clusters or active galactic nuclei.\n\nAccording to the Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog3 (GWTC-3), the binary neutron star merger rate is inferred to be between \n10\n10 and \n1700\n1700 \nGpc\n−\n3\nGpc\n−3\n \nyr\n−\n1\nyr\n−1\n, and the neutron star-black hole merger rate is between \n7.8\n7.8 and \n140\n140 \nGpc\n−\n3\nGpc\n−3\n \nyr\n−\n1\nyr\n−1\n, assuming a constant rate density in the comoving frame and taking the union of \n90\n%\n90% credible intervals for methods used in this work.\n\nThe predicted rates of compact-binary mergers in different types of star clusters, such as globular clusters versus nuclear star clusters, based on GWTC-3 observations, are as follows:\n\nLocal BH-BH coalescence rates: \n2\n2\n−\n6\n+\n9\n22\n−6\n+9\n\t​\n\n Gpc\n−\n3\n−3\n yr\n−\n1\n−1\n, \n4\n2\n−\n20\n+\n88\n42\n−20\n+88\n\t​\n\n Gpc\n−\n3\n−3\n yr\n−\n1\n−1\n, and \n3\n3\n−\n10\n+\n16\n33\n−10\n+16\n\t​\n\n Gpc\n−\n3\n−3\n yr\n−\n1\n−1\n.\nIsolated BNS binaries: \n∼\n150\n∼150 mergers \nGpc\n−\n3\nyr\n−\n1\nGpc\n−3\nyr\n−1\n.\nNSBH mergers in globular clusters: \n50\n50 \nGpc\n−\n3\nyr\n−\n1\nGpc\n−3\nyr\n−1\n.\nNSBH mergers in other models: \n100\n100 \nGpc\n−\n3\nyr\n−\n1\nGpc\n−3\nyr\n−1\n.\n\nFor specific types of star clusters:\n\nGlobular clusters: Studies include Bae et al.

The rate of binary black hole mergers is observed to increase with redshift at a rate proportional to \n(\n1\n+\n𝑧\n)\n𝜅\n(1+z)\nκ\n with \n𝜅\n=\n2.\n9\n−\n1.8\n+\n1.7\nκ=2.9\n−1.8\n+1.7\n\t​\n\n for \n𝑧\n≲\n1\nz≲1.\n\nThe neutron star mass distribution is broad and relatively flat, extending from \n1.\n2\n−\n0.2\n+\n0.1\n1.2\n−0.2\n+0.1\n\t​\n\n to \n2.\n0\n−\n0.3\n+\n0.3\n𝑀\n⊙\n2.0\n−0.3\n+0.3\n\t​\n\nM\n⊙\n\t​\n\n.\n\nThe detections have implications on all source categories, including self-consistent per-source category rates that account for ambiguity in some events' source classifications. The catalogue also puts constraints on a potential mass gap between NS and BH, and compares the inferred neutron star mass distribution to the galactic sample.\n\nThe observations confirm the occurrence of compact-binary mergers in star clusters, with environments such as nuclear star clusters or active galactic nuclei favoring dense and massive systems with deep potential wells.\n\nThe third gravitational-wave transient catalogue (GWTC-3) shows support for eccentricity \n≳\n0.1\n≳0.1 at \n10\n10 Hz, and their results indicate that densely populated star clusters may produce the majority of the observed mergers.\n\nThe detected compact-binary mergers in GWTC-3 have several implications for our understanding of star cluster dynamics and evolution. Computed models producing binary black hole (BBH) mergers are well consistent with the merger masses (\n𝑀\n1\nM\n1\n\t​\n\n, \n𝑀\n2\nM\n2\n\t​\n\n) of the GWTC events. These models, which have higher central concentrations, tend to produce BBH mergers involving PSN-gap black holes more efficiently, accelerating central segregation of the most massive cluster members.\n\nThe formation of compact-binary mergers can occur through various channels, including isolated binaries in galactic fields or dynamical interactions in young clusters. The merger rate density can be related to the formation models and has been studied in the context of astrophysical implications of binary black hole mergers.\n\nThe set of binary mergers that we observe comes with a significant bias as compared to the actual astrophysical BBH population, because of selection effects. The most direct selection effect is that nearby (low redshift) sources are more likely to be detected than far (high redshift) ones. The dependence of signal amplitude on binary masses and spins of binary components also affect the GW signal detectability.\n\nThe analysis of gravitational wave (GW) observations has identified structures in the mass distribution of the observed population. A study examines the implications of the GWTC-3 data on the formation of coalescing black hole binaries from globular clusters, including their mass distributions and comparison to gravitational wave data from GWTC-3.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, GWTC-3 provides a comprehensive update on the searches for gravitational waves from compact binary coalescences, including binary black hole and neutron star mergers. The catalogue confirms the occurrence of compact-binary mergers in the universe and provides new insights into their properties and occurrence in star clusters.\n\nReferences\n\n[1] https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.03634.pdf [2] https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevX.13.041039 [3] https://dcc.ligo.org/LIGO-P2100239/public [4] https://arxiv.org/html/2508.09965v1 [5] https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/522/1/466/7100970 [6] https://arxiv.org/html/2311.00242v2 [7] https://d-nb.info/1258115093/34 [8] https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2515-5172/abdf54 [9] https://baas.aas.org/pub/2022n6i116p05 [10] https://inspirehep.net/literature/2785381 [11] https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/49a5c25bb059c066d9bf2bec973c955299919a46 [12] https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ac1c03 [13] https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1475-7516/2023/08/034 [14] https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevX.13.011048 [15] https://discovery.researcher.life/article/population-of-merging-compact-binaries-inferred-using-gravitational-waves-through-gwtc-3/3cfd0303d5373810bc1577a8b441ac67.pdf [16] https://gwosc.org/eventapi/html [17] https://dcc.ligo.org/cgi-bin/DocDB/ListBy?authorgroupid=3 [18] https://inspirehep.net/literature/1989523 [19] https://inspirehep.net/literature/1961691 [20] https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/news/ligo20201028 [21] https://arxiv.org/html/2408.13383v1 [22] https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2022/09/aa42331-21/aa42331-21.html [23] https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/528/3/5140/7513782 [24] https://www.researchgate.net/publication/294283661_Astrophysical_Implications_of_the_Binary_Black-Hole_Merger_GW150914", "marvel_deepsearch_score": 8, "evaluation_model_type": "openai", "evaluation_model_name": "gpt-4o-mini", "qa_model_type": "openai", "qa_model_name": "gpt-4o-mini", "gpt4o_mini_answer_relevancy": 0.92, "gpt4o_mini_answer_correctness": 0.92, "gpt4o_mini_faithfulness": 0.87, "marvel_standard_answer_relevancy": 0.98, "marvel_standard_answer_correctness": 0.87, "marvel_standard_faithfulness": 0.98, "marvel_deepsearch_answer_relevancy": 0.92, "marvel_deepsearch_answer_correctness": 0.87, "marvel_deepsearch_faithfulness": 0.98}

This notion has been revisited recently with the discovery of new Galactic double neutron stars and GW170817, the first neutron star merger event observed with gravitational waves.\n\nThe Gaussian Distribution Model\n\nThe mass distribution of Galactic double neutron stars (DNSs) is conventionally modeled as a Gaussian distribution, with a mean of \n1.33\n𝑀\n⊙\n1.33M\n⊙\n\t​\n\n and a standard deviation of \n0.09\n𝑀\n⊙\n0.09M\n⊙\n\t​\n\n 2.

To determine with high confidence if recycled and non-recycled neutron stars come from a common distribution, precise component mass measurements of \n≈\n20\n≈20 double neutron stars are required, while approximately \n60\n60 are needed to establish the detailed shape of the distributions.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe mass distribution of binary neutron stars can be effectively modeled using a Gaussian distribution.

Spontaneous scalarization refers to a phenomenon where a scalar field, which is usually expected to be trivial (zero), becomes non-trivial (non-zero) under certain conditions, often related to the properties of the matter fields or the gravitational background. The value \\( \\beta_0 \\) is often associated with the coupling strength of the scalar field to the matter fields or the curvature of spacetime.\n\nWhen \\( \\beta_0 \\) is less than or approximately equal to -4.0, it suggests that the system is in a regime where the scalar field can develop a non-trivial configuration, leading to interesting physical consequences such as modifications to the gravitational field or the dynamics of compact objects like neutron stars. This critical value can be indicative of a phase transition in the system, where the scalar field transitions from a trivial state to a non-trivial one, potentially affecting the stability and the observable properties of the system.\n\nRegarding the greedy selection process in the context of achieving desired accuracy in iterative training, this typically refers to a method used in machine learning or optimization where the algorithm iteratively selects the most informative or relevant data points to improve the model's performance. In a greedy selection process, at each step, the algorithm evaluates the current model's performance and chooses the next data point (or set of data points) that maximally improves the model's accuracy or reduces the error.\n\nThis approach is particularly useful in high-dimensional spaces or when dealing with large datasets, as it allows for a more efficient exploration of the training space.

The greedy selection process is used to achieve desired accuracy in the iterative training space by selecting parameters \n𝜇\n𝑖\nμ\ni\n\t​\n\n for the reduced basis approximation. This process is particularly relevant in the context of Reduced Order Models (ROMs), which facilitate the examination of spontaneous scalarization by minimizing the maximum projection error, denoted as \n𝜎\n𝑖\nσ\ni\n\t​\n\n https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.104.104065. The convergence rate of this process is crucial for its performance and is influenced by the critical value of \n𝜂\n0\nη\n0\n\t​\n\n. In various contexts, including stochastic iterative hard thresholding algorithms and reduced basis methods for parametrized partial differential equations, \n𝜂\n0\nη\n0\n\t​\n\n directly influences the convergence rate. A smaller \n𝜂\n0\nη\n0\n\t​\n\n tends to result in a faster convergence rate https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0021999123001791. The relationship between the critical value of \n𝜂\n0\nη\n0\n\t​\n\n and the convergence rate of the greedy selection process in iterative training spaces is that \n𝜂\n0\nη\n0\n\t​\n\n is inversely related to the convergence rate; a smaller \n𝜂\n0\nη\n0\n\t​\n\n leads to a faster convergence rate. Furthermore, the maximum projection error, denoted as \n𝜎\n𝑖\nσ\ni\n\t​\n\n, plays a pivotal role in the greedy selection process during spontaneous scalarization. It serves as a threshold to iteratively select the next basis in the reduced basis space. Specifically, the waveform corresponding to the maximum \n𝜎\n𝑖\nσ\ni\n\t​\n\n is chosen as the next basis, which is then orthogonalized using the iterated Gram-Schmidt algorithm. The process continues until \n𝜎\n𝑖\nσ\ni\n\t​\n\n is less than or equal to a user-specified tolerable error bound \n𝜎\nσ, at which point the desired orthonormal basis is obtained.

The greedy selection process plays a crucial role in achieving the desired accuracy by minimizing the maximum projection error, denoted as \n𝜎\n𝑖\nσ\ni\n\t​\n\n. This process is particularly relevant in the context of Reduced Order Models (ROMs), which facilitate the examination of spontaneous scalarization by minimizing the maximum projection error, denoted as \n𝜎\n𝑖\nσ\ni\n\t​\n\n [1]. The relationship between the critical value of eta_0 ≲ -4.0 and the maximum projection error, denoted as \n𝜎\n𝑖\nσ\ni\n\t​\n\n, is discussed in the publication \"Spontaneous scalarization\" [4]. In the context of iterative training spaces, the greedy selection process influences the convergence rate and accuracy of the solution during spontaneous scalarization by iteratively generating the next reduced basis to achieve the desired accuracy, namely \n𝜎\n𝑖\n≲\n𝜎\nσ\ni\n\t​\n\n≲σ. A study available at [2] presents the use of greedy algorithms for this purpose, highlighting its significance in iterative training spaces. The appeal of greedy algorithms in learning lies in their ability to greatly reduce the computational burden compared to standard models. This efficiency is particularly relevant in iterative training spaces, where the algorithm's efficiency can significantly impact the convergence rate and accuracy of the solution, especially during spontaneous scalarization [3]. The maximum projection error, denoted as \n𝜎\n𝑖\nσ\ni\n\t​\n\n, plays a pivotal role in the greedy selection process during spontaneous scalarization. It serves as a threshold to iteratively select the next basis in the reduced basis space. Specifically, the waveform corresponding to the maximum \n𝜎\n𝑖\nσ\ni\n\t​\n\n is chosen as the next basis, which is then orthogonalized using the iterated Gram-Schmidt algorithm. The process continues until \n𝜎\n𝑖\nσ\ni\n\t​\n\n is less than or equal to a user-specified tolerable error bound \n𝜎\nσ, at which point the desired orthonormal basis is obtained.

This contamination can arise from various sources, such as background noise, overlapping spectral lines, or other signals that interfere with the measurement of the target signal.\n\n### Significance of Line-Contamination Fraction\n\n1. **Signal Integrity**: A lower line-contamination fraction indicates a cleaner signal, which is crucial for accurate measurements. High contamination can lead to misinterpretation of the data, affecting the reliability of the results.\n\n2. **Sensitivity and Detection Limits**: The line-contamination fraction directly impacts the sensitivity of the detector. A high contamination fraction can mask the desired signal, making it harder to detect low-level signals. This is particularly important in applications where detecting weak signals is critical.\n\n3. **Dynamic Range**: The presence of contamination can reduce the effective dynamic range of the detector. If the contamination is significant, it can limit the range of signal levels that can be accurately measured.\n\n### Performance in Equal-Sensitivity Case vs. Line-Contamination Fraction of 0.1\n\n1. **Equal-Sensitivity Case**: In an ideal scenario where there is no line contamination (i.e., a line-contamination fraction of 0), the detector can achieve maximum sensitivity and accuracy. The performance metrics, such as signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), are optimized, allowing for the detection of weak signals without interference.\n\n2. **Line-Contamination Fraction of 0.1**: When the line-contamination fraction is set at 0.1, it means that 10% of the detected signal is due to contamination. This can significantly degrade the performance of the detector:\n   - **Reduced SNR**: The presence of contamination adds noise to the measurement, reducing the SNR. This makes it more challenging to distinguish the desired signal from the background.\n   - **Increased Uncertainty**: The uncertainty in the measurement increases due to the additional noise introduced by the contamination. This can lead to less reliable results and potentially erroneous conclusions.\n   - **Threshold for Detection**: The effective threshold for detecting the desired signal may be raised, meaning that weaker signals that would have been detectable in the equal-sensitivity case may now fall below the detection threshold.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, the line-contamination fraction is a critical parameter in the performance of sensitive detectors. A lower contamination fraction leads to better sensitivity, accuracy, and reliability of measurements. In contrast, a contamination fraction of 0.1 introduces significant challenges, reducing the effectiveness of the detector and complicating the interpretation of results.

In this context, \\( m_\\chi \\) typically refers to the mass of a dark matter particle, which can be a boson in certain theoretical models, such as scalar field dark matter or axions.\n\n### Core Formation and Boson Mass\n\n1. **Boson Mass and Core Formation**: The mass of the dark matter particle influences the dynamics of halo formation. For bosonic dark matter candidates, such as scalar fields, the mass can affect the size and density profile of the core of dark matter halos. Lighter bosons tend to lead to more extended and smoother density profiles, while heavier bosons can lead to more concentrated cores.\n\n2. **Values of \\( m_\\chi \\)**: For values of \\( m_\\chi \\) around 400 MeV to 500 MeV, the mass is relatively low compared to typical WIMP (Weakly Interacting Massive Particle) candidates, which are often in the GeV range. At these masses, the bosonic nature of the particles can lead to significant quantum effects, such as wave-like behavior, which can influence the formation of the halo's core.\n\n3. **Core vs. Halo Structure**: In the context of dark matter halo formation, the mass of the boson can determine whether a halo develops a core or a cusp. Lighter bosons (like those around 400 MeV) may lead to softer cores, while heavier bosons (like those around 500 MeV) might create more pronounced cusps in the density profile. This is due to the balance between gravitational attraction and the pressure from the bosonic field.\n\n### Mass-Radius (m-r) Profile\n\n1. **m-r Profile**: The mass-radius profile of a dark matter halo describes how the mass of the halo is distributed as a function of radius. In general, for dark matter halos, the density profile can be described by models such as the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile or the Burkert profile, which can exhibit different behaviors depending on the nature of the dark matter.\n\n2. **Impact of Boson Mass on m-r Profile**: The boson mass affects the m-r profile in the following ways:\n   - **Density Distribution**: Heavier bosons may lead to a steeper density profile at small radii, resulting in a more pronounced peak in the mass distribution.\n   - **Core Size**: The core size of the halo can be influenced by the mass of the boson. A lighter boson may result in a larger core radius, while a heavier boson may lead to a smaller core and a steeper transition to the outer halo.\n\n3. **Observational Consequences**: The differences in core formation and m-r profiles have implications for observations of galaxy rotation curves and gravitational lensing. For instance, a halo with a core may lead to flat rotation curves at larger radii, while a cuspy halo may show rising rotation curves.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, the mass of bosonic dark matter candidates, particularly in the range of 400 to 500 MeV, plays a crucial role in determining the structure of dark matter halos, including core formation and the resulting mass-radius profiles.

This article aims to provide an overview of the current understanding of this relationship and its implications for the mass-radius ($m$-$r$) profile.\n\n## Bosonic Dark Matter Distribution\n\nThe bosonic dark matter (DM) can be distributed as a core inside the neutron star (NS) or as a halo around it, leading to the formation of a DM admixed NS. The distribution of bosonic DM can result in a core or halo configuration, influencing the $m$-$r$ profile in the context of dark matter halo formation[^1]. This relationship is particularly relevant when considering the boson mass and dark matter core formation for values of $m_{\\chi}$ at 400 and 500 MeV.\n\n## Dark Matter Halo Formation\n\nThe mass distribution or density profile of any particular halo is given by $\\rho(r) = \\rho_s g(r/r_s)$, where $\\rho_s$ and $r_s$ are a scale density and scale radius, and the dimensionless function $g$ is universal[^3]. Various profiles have been proposed to describe dark matter halos, including the NFW profile, Moore profile, Einasto profile, and Burkert profile.\n\n## Impact on Neutron Star Properties\n\nDark matter in a neutron star core leads to a smaller radius, while a halo increases tidal deformability and gravitational mass[^4]. The relationship between the boson mass and dark matter core formation, particularly for values of $m_\\chi$ at 400 and 500 MeV, and its relation to the $m$-$r$ profile in the context of dark matter halo formation, is discussed in the context of dark matter affecting neutron star properties.\n\n## Self-Interacting Dark Matter\n\nThe relationship between the boson mass and dark matter core formation can be understood in the context of self-interacting dark matter[^5]. The dark matter $\\chi$ is a Standard Model singlet charged under $U(1)_X$ gauge interaction with a mass $m_\\chi \\sim$ TeV and a light gauge boson $V$ with mass $m_V \\sim$ MeV, leading to a long-range, velocity-dependent interaction. This interaction can solve the cusp-core and too big to fail problems.\n\n## Calculations and Results\n\nThe $M - R$ profiles of dark matter admixed strange stars are calculated for various dark matter percentages and fixed values of $\\lambda = \\pi$ and $m_\\chi$ ranging from 250 MeV to 500 MeV[^2].

The boson mass influences the mass-radius ($m$-$r$) profile in the context of dark matter halo formation, with specific calculations provided for dark matter admixed strange stars showing variations in pressure profiles and the effective equation of state (EOS) with $m_\\chi$. The distribution of bosonic dark matter can result in a core or halo configuration around neutron stars, affecting their properties. The presence of dark matter in a neutron star core leads to a smaller radius, while a halo increases tidal deformability and gravitational mass.\n\nThe studies suggest that the properties of dark matter halos and neutron stars are sensitive to the boson mass, and further research is needed to understand the implications of these findings. The variations in boson mass, specifically at 400 MeV and 500 MeV, influence the density profile and equation of state of dark matter admixed neutron stars by altering their mass, radius, and tidal deformability. A 400 MeV boson mass tends to decrease the maximum mass and radius of strange stars.\n\nThe stability and structure of these stars are sensitive to the dark matter boson mass, with implications for their evolutionary paths and observational signatures. The references provided include various publications discussing the relationship between the boson mass and dark matter core formation, including arXiv preprint, ResearchGate publication, and IOP Science Article.\n\nThe impact of boson mass values at 400 and 500 MeV on the mass-radius profile of dark matter admixed neutron stars is significant, considering the distribution of bosonic dark matter as a core or halo. The presence of dark matter can lead to a reduction or increase in the mass and radius of the neutron star, depending on the distribution of dark matter. The study of dark matter admixed neutron stars is informed by observational data on neutron star radii and tidal deformability, which can be obtained from gravitational wave data.\n\nIn conclusion, the relationship between the boson mass and dark matter core formation, particularly for values of \n𝑚\n𝜒\nm\nχ\n\t​\n\n at 400 and 500 MeV, is an important area of research in the context of dark matter halo formation and its impact on neutron star properties. Further research is needed to understand the implications of these findings and to constrain the properties of dark matter.\n\nThe relationship between the boson mass and dark matter core formation can be understood in the context of self-interacting dark matter. The dark matter \n𝜒\nχ is a Standard Model singlet charged under \n𝑈\n(\n1\n)\n𝑋\nU(1)\nX\n\t​\n\n gauge interaction with a mass \n𝑚\n𝜒\n∼\nm\nχ\n\t​\n\n∼ TeV and a light gauge boson \n𝑉\nV with mass \n𝑚\n𝑉\n∼\nm\nV\n\t​\n\n∼ MeV, leading to a long-range, velocity-dependent interaction.\n\nThe \n𝑀\n−\n𝑅\nM−R profiles of dark matter admixed strange stars are calculated for various dark matter percentages and fixed values of \n𝜆\n=\n𝜋\nλ=π and \n𝑚\n𝜒\nm\nχ\n\t​\n\n ranging from 250 MeV to 500 MeV. The effective EOS varies with \n𝑚\n𝜒\nm\nχ\n\t​\n\n, with specific values given for \n𝑚\n𝜒\nm\nχ\n\t​\n\n = 100, 200, 300, 400, and 500 MeV. For \n𝑚\n𝜒\nm\nχ\n\t​\n\n = 400 MeV and \n𝑚\n𝜒\nm\nχ\n\t​\n\n = 500 MeV, the pressure profiles of dark matter admixed strange stars are also calculated for fixed values of \n𝜆\n=\n𝜋\nλ=π and dark matter percentage = 20%.\n\nThe tidal deformability \nΛ\nΛ is defined as \nΛ\n=\n𝜆\n/\n(\n𝐺\n𝑀\n/\n𝑐\n2\n)\n−\n5\n=\n2\n/\n3\n𝑘\n2\n(\n𝑅\n/\n𝑐\n2\n/\n𝐺\n𝑀\n)\n5\nΛ=λ/(GM/c\n2\n)\n−5\n=2/3k\n2\n\t​\n\n(R/c\n2\n/GM)\n5\n. The second (quadrupole) tidal Love number \n𝑘\n2\nk\n2\n\t​\n\n can be obtained from the equation. The mass-radius relationship and tidal deformability of DANSs are altered significantly depending on the boson mass (\n𝑚\n𝜒\nm\nχ\n\t​\n\n), self-coupling constant (\n𝜆\nλ), and DM fraction (\n𝐹\n𝜒\nF\nχ\n\t​\n\n).\n\nIn conclusion, the relationship between the boson mass and dark matter core formation, particularly for values of \n𝑚\n𝜒\nm\nχ\n\t​\n\n at 400 and 500 MeV, is an important area of research in the context of dark matter halo formation and its impact on neutron star properties.

This trend is often attributed to the fact that more luminous AGNs are typically associated with more massive black holes and more energetic accretion processes, which can lead to less obscuration by surrounding material.\n\nIn terms of binary black hole (BBH) flares from type-I AGNs, the detectability of these flares is influenced by the AGN's luminosity and its obscuration. Type-I AGNs are characterized by their broad emission lines and are generally less obscured than type-II AGNs. As the luminosity increases, the likelihood of detecting BBH flares also increases, as higher luminosity AGNs are more likely to be unobscured and thus more visible to observers.\n\nThe relationship between the fraction of unobscured AGNs and the detectability of BBH flares suggests that in more luminous AGNs, the conditions are more favorable for observing these flares. This is because unobscured AGNs allow for clearer observations of the accretion processes and potential interactions between binary black holes, which can produce detectable flares.\n\nIn summary, the estimated fraction of unobscured AGNs increases with bolometric luminosity, enhancing the detectability of BBH flares in type-I AGNs.

We need to find specific details or a consensus among these documents.\n\n## 3: Identify Key Information\n- Document1 mentions that the estimated fraction of unobscured AGNs that varies with bolometric luminosity is related to the detectability of BBH flares from type-I AGNs, with a detectability limit of $\\lambda < 0.18$ if only BBH flares from type-I AGNs were detectable.\n- Document3 and others hint at the relationship but refer to related publications for specifics.\n- Document5 states that the fraction of unobscured AGNs increases with bolometric luminosity $L_X$.\n- Document8 provides a detailed study on the spectral energy distributions of unobscured AGNs but does not give a specific fraction.\n- Document12 discusses the connection between BBH mergers and AGNs, mentioning that for AGNs more luminous than $\\approx10^{44.3} \\rm erg \\ s^{-1}$, 13 BBH mergers are not enough to reject the hypothesis of no connection with $3\\sigma$ significance.\n\n## 4: Analyze and Synthesize Information\nWhile several documents discuss the relationship between unobscured AGNs, bolometric luminosity, and BBH flares, a specific, straightforward fraction that varies with bolometric luminosity and directly relates to BBH flare detectability is not explicitly stated. However, Document1 provides a clue with $\\lambda < 0.18$ for detectability under certain conditions.\n\n## 5: Conclusion\nGiven the information, the most direct and relevant answer to the query is related to how the fraction of unobscured AGNs and bolometric luminosity influences BBH flare detectability. However, a precise numerical fraction that directly answers the query isn't explicitly provided in a singular document but Document1 offers $\\lambda < 0.18$ as a threshold.\n\n<ANSWER>\nThe estimated fraction of unobscured active galactic nuclei (AGNs) that varies with bolometric luminosity is related to the detectability of binary black hole (BBH) flares from type-I AGNs. A detectability limit of $\\lambda < 0.18$ has been mentioned if only BBH flares from type-I AGNs were detectable. Additionally, the fraction of unobscured AGNs increases with bolometric luminosity. This relationship is crucial for understanding the detectability of BBH flares from type-I AGNs, as indicated in various studies on AGN unification and BBH mergers.\n</ANSWER>\n\n# The Relationship Between Unobscured Active Galactic Nuclei and Binary Black Hole Flares\n====================================================================================\n\nThe estimated fraction of unobscured active galactic nuclei (AGNs) that varies with bolometric luminosity is closely related to the detectability of binary black hole (BBH) flares from type-I AGNs. Research suggests that the detectability limit for BBH flares from type-I AGNs is $\\lambda < 0.18$ if only BBH flares from type-I AGNs were detectable, as opposed to $\\lambda < 0.8$ otherwise [1].\n\n## Fraction of Unobscured AGNs and Bolometric Luminosity\n\nStudies have shown that the fraction of unobscured AGNs increases with bolometric luminosity $L_X$, with spectroscopic type-1 AGNs and QSOV type-1 AGNs tend to have higher $L_X$ compared to type-2 AGNs [2]. Additionally, the fractional contribution of star formation to the total bolometric luminosity of galactic centers decreases with AGN luminosity [3].\n\n## Relationship with BBH Flares\n\nThe detectability of BBH flares from type-I AGNs is linked to the estimated fraction of unobscured AGNs, which varies with bolometric luminosity. A study found that the estimated fraction of unobscured AGNs that varies with bolometric luminosity is related to the detectability of BBH flares from type-I AGNs; however, specific details are provided in a related publication [4].\n\n## AGN Unification and Environment\n\nResearch on AGN unification suggests that all AGNs are the same type of object viewed from different angles [5]. A study using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and Galaxy Zoo found strong differences in the galaxy neighbors to Type-1 and Type-2 AGNs [5].\n\n## Observational Evidence\n\nRecent observations have provided evidence for the association of gravitational-wave (GW) binary black hole (BBH) mergers with flares in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) [6]. A study presented one of the largest multiwavelength studies of simultaneous optical-to-X-ray spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of unobscured AGNs in the local Universe [7].\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the estimated fraction of unobscured active galactic nuclei (AGNs) that varies with bolometric luminosity plays a crucial role in the detectability of binary black hole (BBH) flares from type-I AGNs. Further research is needed to understand the relationship between AGN luminosity, obscuration, and BBH merger rates.\n\n## References\n\n[1] [https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.110.083005](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.110.083005)\n[2] [https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ab1eb1](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ab1eb1)\n[3] [https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/697/1/182](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/697/1/182)\n[4] [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/374726055_The_most_luminous_AGN_do_not_produce_the_majority_of_the_detected_stellar-mass_black_hole_binary_mergers_in_the_local_Universe](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/374726055_The_most_luminous_AGN_do_not_produce_the_majority_of_the_detected_stellar-mass_black_hole_binary_mergers_in_the_local_Universe)\n[5] [https://www.nature.com/articles/nphys2951](https://www.nature.com/articles/nphys2951)\n[6] [https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ac0883](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ac0883)\n[7] [https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2024/11/aa50567-24/aa50567-24.html](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2024/11/aa50567-24/aa50567-24.html)", "marvel_standard_score": 7, "marvel_deepsearch_answer": "KEY_FACTS\n\n<TASK_OUTPUT>\n\nThe estimated fraction of unobscured active galactic nuclei (AGNs) varies with bolometric luminosity and is closely related to the detectability of binary black hole (BBH) flares from type-I AGNs [@\"https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.110.083005\"].\n∼\n20\n%\n∼20% (\n∼\n26\n%\n∼26%) of AGNs with luminosity \n10\n44\n10\n44\n (\n10\n46\n10\n46\n) erg s\n−\n1\n−1\n are visible at optical wavelengths [@\"https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.110.083005\"].\nThe fraction of unobscured AGNs increases with bolometric luminosity \n𝐿\n𝑋\nL\nX\n\t​\n\n, with spectroscopic type-1 AGNs and QSOV type-1 AGNs tend to have higher \n𝐿\n𝑋\nL\nX\n\t​\n\n compared to type-2 AGNs [@\"https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.110.083005\"].\nType-I AGNs comprise \n∼\n22\n%\n∼22% of the entire AGN sample.\nThe detectability limit for BBH flares from type-I AGNs is \n𝜆\n<\n0.18\nλ<0.18 if only BBH flares from type-I AGNs were detectable, as opposed to \n𝜆\n<\n0.8\nλ<0.8 otherwise [@\"https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.110.083005\"].\nSpecific bolometric luminosity thresholds for type-I AGNs that correlate with a significant change in the detectability of binary black hole flares are \n10\n45\n10\n45\n erg s\n−\n1\n−1\n, \n10\n45.5\n10\n45.5\n erg s\n−\n1\n−1\n, and \n10\n46\n10\n46\n erg s\n−\n1\n−1\n [@\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/374726055_The_most_luminous_AGN_do_not_produce_the_majority_of_the_detected_stellar-mass_black_hole_binary_mergers_in_the_local_Universe\"].\nFor the \n10\n45.5\n10\n45.5\n erg s\n−\n1\n−1\n and \n10\n46\n10\n46\n erg s\n−\n1\n−1\n threshold catalogues, the fraction of detected mergers originated in AGN drops to ≈5 per cent and ≈2 per cent, respectively [@\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/374726055_The_most_luminous_AGN_do_not_produce_the_majority_of_the_detected_stellar-mass_black_hole_binary_mergers_in_the_local_Universe\"].\nThe range of luminosity has been enlarged to more than 20 decades, i.e., from \n∼\n10\n31\n∼10\n31\n erg s\n−\n1\n−1\n to \n∼\n10\n52\n∼10\n52\n erg s\n−\n1\n−1\n, allowing for better constraining of the correlation between the fraction of unobscured AGNs and the detectability of BBH flares from type-I AGNs at different bolometric luminosity ranges. </TASK_OUTPUT>\nFINER_DETAILS\n\n<TASK_OUTPUT> The estimated fraction of unobscured active galactic nuclei (AGNs) that varies with bolometric luminosity is closely related to the detectability of binary black hole (BBH) flares from type-I AGNs.

(2019).\n</ANSWER>\n\n# Fiducial Collapsar Simulation Model: Key Parameters and Conditions\nThe fiducial collapsar simulation model $c$ is a complex model used to study the collapse of rotating massive stars, resulting in hyperaccreting black holes (BHs), also known as \"collapsars\". This model is a leading candidate for explaining long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs).\n\n## Overview of the Fiducial Collapsar Simulation Model\nThe fiducial collapsar simulation model $c$ employs a stellar mass of $M_{\\star} = 20 M_{\\odot}$ and uses the relativistic ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) approximation, which is a valid approximation for much of the GRB jet. The simulation model works in spherical coordinates $(r, \\theta, \\phi)$ and cylindrical coordinates $R = r \\sin \\theta, z = r \\cos \\theta$. The units used in the simulation are $c = r_0 = 1$, where $c$ is the speed of light and $r_0$ is the radius of the compact object.\n\n## Key Parameters and Conditions\nThe key parameters and conditions defined in the fiducial collapsar simulation model $c$ include:\n\n* **Stellar Mass and Composition**: A $1.7 M_{\\odot}$ iron core of a $25 M_{\\odot}$ presupernova star that has collapsed, forming a black hole with an accreting $7 M_{\\odot}$ helium envelope.\n* **Initial Conditions**: A spherically symmetric progenitor model with a small, latitude-dependent angular momentum and a weak split-monopole magnetic field.\n* **Simulation Parameters**: The model $C_c$ has parameters such as $H/R = 0.3$, with other parameters being $0$, $0.8$, $10$, $5.4$, $10^5$, $1.5 \\times 10^{49}$, $5;9$, $74;130$, $\\lesssim 10^{-2}$, and $100-200$.\n* **Number of CCSNe and r-process Collapsars**: NSN (Number of CCSNe) with a fiducial value of $3000$, ranging from $30$ to $30,000$; $\\alpha N_r$ (Average number of r-process collapsars) with a fiducial value of $3$, ranging from $2$ to $4$.\n* **r-process Yield and Distribution**: $M_{r,min}$ (Minimum r-process yield produced per collapsar) with a fiducial value of $3 \\times 10^{-2}$, ranging from $3 \\times 10^{-4}$ to $3 \\times 10^{-1}$; $\\alpha$ (Power-law exponent of $M_r$ distribution) with a fiducial value of $2.8$, ranging from $2.2$ to $6$.\n* **Effective Supernovae Iron Yield**: $y_{Fe,eff}$ (Effective supernovae iron yield into the total gas mass) with a fiducial value of $10^{-9}$, ranging from $10^{-10}$ to $10^{-7}$.\n\n## Simulation Results and Discussion\nThe simulations show that after an initial transient, the flow settles into a complex convolution of several distinct, time-dependent flow components, including an accretion torus, its corona and outflow, an inflow, and an outflow in the polar funnel. The magnetic field is amplified by shear and the magnetorotational instability (MRI), driving the evolution of the torus, including mass accretion onto a black hole.\n\n## Conclusion\nThe fiducial collapsar simulation model $c$ provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the collapse of rotating massive stars and the resulting hyperaccreting black holes. The model has been used to study various aspects of collapsars, including the properties of the jets launched by the simulation, the disk-jet system, and the impact of changes on the results.\n\n##

These angles affect the final orientation of the black hole spins by determining the angular momentum distribution of the disks, which is influenced by the chaotic nature of three-body dynamics during the disruptions.", "gpt4o_mini_answer": "In the context of binary black hole systems, particularly during the merger phase, the dynamics of the accretion disk formed can be influenced by the spins of the black holes involved. The orientation of the disk relative to the spins of the black holes is crucial in determining the final spin orientation of the merged black hole.\n\n1. **Spin Direction and Disk Orientation**: The angle between the spin axis of each black hole and the angular momentum vector of the accretion disk can vary significantly. If the spins of the black holes are aligned with the orbital angular momentum of the binary system, the disk tends to form in a plane that is also aligned with these spins. Conversely, if the spins are misaligned, the disk can form at an angle to the spin axes of the black holes.\n\n2. **Angles of the Disk**: The angle of the disk relative to the spin direction of the black holes can be quantified using the tilt angle, which is the angle between the spin vector of the black hole and the normal vector of the disk. This tilt angle can affect the dynamics of the accretion process, including how material is funneled into the black holes and how angular momentum is transferred.\n\n3. **Final Orientation of Black Hole Spins**: The final spin of the merged black hole is influenced by the spins of the original black holes and the angular momentum of the accretion disk. If the disk is aligned with the spins, it can enhance the final spin of the merged black hole in the direction of the original spins. If the disk is misaligned, it can lead to a more complex interaction, potentially resulting in a final spin that is less than the maximum possible value.\n\n4. **Impact of Disk Dynamics**: The dynamics of the disk can also lead to phenomena such as the Bardeen-Petterson effect, where the inner regions of the disk align with the black hole's spin while the outer regions may remain misaligned. This can result in a gradual alignment of the black hole spins over time, depending on the mass and angular momentum of the disk.\n\nIn summary, the angles of the disk formed during disruptions in relation to the binary black hole's spin direction play a significant role in determining the final orientation and magnitude of the spins of the merged black hole. The interplay between the spins, the disk dynamics, and the gravitational interactions ultimately shapes the characteristics of the resulting black hole.", "gpt4o_mini_score": 8, "marvel_standard_answer": "<QUERY> What are the angles of the disk formed during the disruptions in relation to the binary black hole s spin direction, and how do these angles affect the final orientation of the black hole spins? </QUERY>\n\nAfter carefully reading the provided <TEXT> from various documents, I will perform a needle-in-a-haystack search to find the most relevant answer to the query.\n\nThe query is directly addressed in **Document3** and **Document2**, which discuss the angles of the disk formed during disruptions in relation to the binary black hole's spin direction and their effects on the final orientation of the black hole spins.\n\n**Document3** mentions that the study investigates \"the angles of the disk formed during disruptions in relation to the binary black hole's spin direction, and how these angles affect the final orientation of the black hole spins.\" It discusses the cosmic evolution of black hole spin and galaxy orientations, noting that the majority of the most massive BHs have BH spins highly aligned with $J_{star}$, even at low redshift $z =0.18$. The distribution of $cos(\\Psi_{star, BH})$ at a given redshift indicates that BH spins are more likely to be aligned with their host galaxy spin.\n\n**Document2** specifically notes that \"The misalignment angle between the disk and the final black hole's spin axis has a strong effect on the mass of the post-merger accretion disk, particularly for angles greater than $\\approx40°$.\" This indicates that the angles of the disk formed during disruptions significantly affect the final orientation of the black hole spins.\n\n**Document1** also provides relevant information on how the spin direction of black holes in binary systems can be influenced by gas accretion.

Specifically, misalignment angles greater than $\\approx40°$ have a strong effect on the mass of the post-merger accretion disk. The studies suggest that black hole spins tend to be aligned with the angular momentum of their host galaxy, with the distribution of $cos(\\Psi_{star, BH})$ indicating a preference for alignment, particularly at high redshift ($z =3 -2$).\n\nSources:\n- https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2024/06/aa49101-23/aa49101-23.html\n- https://authors.library.caltech.edu/records/cmnqz-wqt62\n\n</ANSWER>\n\n# Understanding Black Hole Spin and Disk Alignment\n====================================================\n\nThe study of black hole spin and disk alignment is crucial in understanding the evolution of supermassive black holes and their host galaxies. Recent research has shed light on the angles of the disk formed during disruptions in relation to the binary black hole's spin direction and how these angles affect the final orientation of the black hole spins.\n\n## Disk Formation and Black Hole Spin Alignment\n--------------------------------------------\n\nWhen a binary accretes gas coherently but from a misaligned direction, it is much easier to realign the BH spins than the binary's orbital plane. The final spin direction $J_{spin}$ tends to align with the total angular momentum vector $\\vec{J}_{tot}=\\vec{J}_{gas}+\\vec{J}_{spin}$. If the gas flow is coplanar with the binary orbital plane, the angular momentum of the inflowing gas tends to align the BH spins with the binary angular momentum, leading to spin directions approximately perpendicular to the orbital plane [1].\n\n## The Role of Disk Tilt and Misalignment\n-----------------------------------------\n\nThe disk formed during disruptions is tilted with respect to the final black hole's spin axis, causing precession on a timescale longer than the accretion time. The misalignment angle between the disk and the final black hole's spin axis has a strong effect on the mass of the post-merger accretion disk, particularly for angles greater than $\\approx40°$. This was found in a study that used a simple Γ-law equation of state and focused on 3:1 mass-ratio systems [2].\n\n## Evolution of Supermassive Black Holes and Their Host Galaxies\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe cosmic evolution of black hole spin and galaxy orientations is investigated using the NEWHorizon and Galactica simulations. These simulations have sufficient resolution to capture the injection scale of gas turbulence and a multiphase interstellar medium. The analysis of typical individual evolution of the most massive BHs suggests the occurrence of three phases in the evolution of $\\Psi_{star, BH}$, the angle between the BH spin and the angular momentum of the host galaxy [3].\n\n## Properties of Tilted Accretion Flows\n--------------------------------------\n\nA systematic study of the properties of tilted accretion flows around spinning black holes was conducted, covering a range of tilt angles and black hole spins. The tilted disks quickly reach a warped and twisted shape that rigidly precesses about the black hole spin axis with deformations in shape large enough to hinder the application of linear bending wave theory [4].\n\n## Origin of Spin in Binary Black Holes\n--------------------------------------\n\nThe origin of spin in binary black holes is also an area of active research. The spin of the first-born black hole is negligible because it lost its envelope after it expanded to become a giant star. The spin of the second-born black hole is determined by the tidal spin up of its naked helium star progenitor by the first-born black hole companion after the binary finished the common-envelope phase [5].\n\n## Conclusion\n----------\n\nIn conclusion, the study of black hole spin and disk alignment is a complex and multifaceted field. The angles of the disk formed during disruptions in relation to the binary black hole's spin direction play a crucial role in determining the final orientation of the black hole spins. Further research is needed to fully understand the evolution of supermassive black holes and their host galaxies.\n\n## References\n--------------\n\n* [1] [https://arxiv.org/html/2508.08558v1](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.08558v1)\n* [2] [https://authors.library.caltech.edu/records/cmnqz-wqt62](https://authors.library.caltech.edu/records/cmnqz-wqt62)\n* [3] [https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2024/06/aa49101-23/aa49101-23.html](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2024/06/aa49101-23/aa49101-23.html)\n* [4] [https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ab089e](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ab089e)\n* [5] [https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2020/03/aa36204-19/aa36204-19.html](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2020/03/aa36204-19/aa36204-19.html)", "marvel_standard_score": 7, "marvel_deepsearch_answer": "KEY_FACTS\n\n<TASK_OUTPUT>\n\nThe angles of the disk formed during disruptions in relation to the binary black hole's spin direction significantly affect the final orientation of the black hole spins [@\"https://authors.library.caltech.edu/records/cmnqz-wqt62\"].\nMisalignment angles greater than \n≈\n40\n°\n≈40° between the disk and the final black hole's spin axis have a strong effect on the mass of the post-merger accretion disk [@\"https://authors.library.caltech.edu/records/cmnqz-wqt62\"].\nThe final spin direction \n𝐽\n𝑠\n𝑝\n𝑖\n𝑛\nJ\nspin\n\t​\n\n tends to align with the total angular momentum vector \n𝐽\n⃗\n𝑡\n𝑜\n𝑡\n=\n𝐽\n⃗\n𝑔\n𝑎\n𝑠\n+\n𝐽\n⃗\n𝑠\n𝑝\n𝑖\n𝑛\nJ\ntot\n\t​\n\n=\nJ\ngas\n\t​\n\n+\nJ\nspin\n\t​\n\n [@\"https://arxiv.org/html/2508.08558v1\"].\nThe misalignment angle between the disk and the final black hole's spin axis affects the post-merger disk mass, particularly for angles greater than \n≈\n40\n°\n≈40° [@\"https://authors.library.caltech.edu/records/cmnqz-wqt62\"].\nThe disk tilt angle influences the final spin orientation, with the accretion disk and jet aligning with the spin at small radius.\nThe angles of the disk formed during disruptions can affect the alignment of the binary black hole spins with the angular momentum of their host galaxy by altering the effective spin distribution of binary black hole mergers [@\"url:https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2310.03832.pdf&gt\"].\nMinidisks formed around black holes during disruptions can exhibit notable characteristics, including meridional circulation, which can influence the spin distribution [@\"url:https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2310.03832.pdf&gt\"].\nThe alignment of minidisks with the AGN disk midplane or the binary orbital plane depends on the binary inclination and the handedness of the binary [@\"url:https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2310.03832.pdf&gt\"].\nTilted accretion disks can exhibit a range of interesting phenomena, including precessing coronae and jets, standing nozzle shocks, and quasi-periodic oscillations [@\"url:https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-981-97-8522-3_11\"].\nThe Lense-Thirring effect causes the disk to precess, leading to changes in the mass accretion rate, as described by the equation \n𝜔\n=\n2\n𝐺\n𝐽\n𝑐\n2\n𝑟\n3\nω=\nc\n2\nr\n3\n2GJ\n\t​\n\n [@\"url:https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-981-97-8522-3_11\"].\nThe tilt angle of the disk can have significant effects on the mass accretion rate and the evolution of the binary black hole system [@\"url:https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.93.064055\"]. </TASK_OUTPUT>\nFINER_DETAILS\n\n<TASK_OUTPUT> The angles of the disk formed during disruptions in relation to the binary black hole's spin direction significantly affect the final orientation of the black hole spins.

Recent research has shed light on the angles of the disk formed during disruptions in relation to the binary black hole's spin direction and how these angles affect the final orientation of the black hole spins. The misalignment angle between the disk and the final black hole's spin axis has a strong effect on the mass of the post-merger accretion disk, particularly for angles greater than \n≈\n40\n°\n≈40°. The majority of massive black holes have spins highly aligned with the angular momentum of their host galaxy. The angles of the disk formed during disruptions in relation to the binary black hole's spin direction significantly affect the final orientation of the black hole spins. Specifically, misalignment angles greater than \n≈\n40\n°\n≈40° have a strong effect on the mass of the post-merger accretion disk. The studies suggest that black hole spins tend to be aligned with the angular momentum of their host galaxy, with the distribution of \n𝑐\n𝑜\n𝑠\n(\nΨ\n𝑠\n𝑡\n𝑎\n𝑟\n,\n𝐵\n𝐻\n)\ncos(Ψ\nstar,BH\n\t​\n\n) indicating a preference for alignment, particularly at high redshift (\n𝑧\n=\n3\n−\n2\nz=3−2). The alignment of minidisks around black holes during disruptions can exhibit notable characteristics, including meridional circulation, which can influence the spin distribution.

This article aims to combine the different perspectives and findings from experts in the field.\n\n## Bayesian Analysis Framework\n\nThe Bayesian analysis framework is widely used to integrate constraints from nuclear experiments and astrophysical observations to assess the viability of different equation of state (EOS) scenarios for neutron stars. The posterior probability of a given EOS is determined by the product of its prior probability and a likelihood function, normalized by the model evidence, as expressed by $p_k = \\frac{q_kL_k}{\\int q_lL_ldl}$ (1), where $q_k$ is the prior probability, $L_k$ is the likelihood, and $\\int q_lL_ldl$ is the model evidence [1].\n\n## Likelihood Function and Constraints\n\nThe likelihood function $L(\\vec{\\phi}_k)$ is given by $L_S(\\vec{\\phi}_k)L_{Mmax}(\\vec{\\phi}_k)L_{M-R}(\\vec{\\phi}_k)L_{\\Lambda}(\\vec{\\phi}_k)w_{pQCD}(\\vec{\\phi}_k)$ (2), incorporating symmetry energy estimates, high-mass pulsar measurements, simultaneous mass-radius measurements, tidal deformability data, and perturbative QCD (pQCD) input [1]. The highest reliably measured neutron star masses are considered as maximum mass constraints.\n\n## Probabilistic Constraints\n\nThe probabilistic constraint used to account for the measured posterior probability density function (pdf) in the context of the heaviest observed neutron star mass is given by $2.0 M_{\\odot} < m_{max} <2.2 M_{\\odot}$ (68 per cent) and $2.0 M_{\\odot} < m_{max} <2.6 M_{\\odot}$ (90 per cent) [2].\n\n## Impact of Perturbative QCD\n\nThe impact of perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (pQCD) on probabilistic distributions is considered, noting that pQCD does not change the boundaries in the mass-radius plane [3].\n\n## Joint Posterior Distribution\n\nThe joint posterior distribution of the EOS and population hyperparameters is given by $P(\\theta|D)=\\frac{P(D|\\theta)\\times P(\\theta)}{P(D)}$, where $\\theta$ represents the set of hyperparameters that describe the EOS and mass distribution of neutron stars [4].\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the probabilistic constraint used to account for the measured posterior probability density function (pdf) in the context of the heaviest observed neutron star mass is analyzed using various Bayesian analysis frameworks and approaches. The findings suggest that the probabilistic constraint is given by $2.0 M_{\\odot} < m_{max} <2.2 M_{\\odot}$ (68 per cent) and $2.0 M_{\\odot} < m_{max} <2.6 M_{\\odot}$ (90 per cent).\n\n## References\n\n[1] [https://indico.cern.ch/event/1139644/papers/5456523/files/12728-QM_23_proceedings-2.pdf](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1139644/papers/5456523/files/12728-QM_23_proceedings-2.pdf)\n[2] [https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/478/1/1377/4987228](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/478/1/1377/4987228)\n[3] [https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevC.111.015810](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevC.111.015810)\n[4] [https://arxiv.org/html/2408.15192v2](https://arxiv.org/html/2408.15192v2)\n\n</ARTICLE>", "marvel_standard_score": 7, "marvel_deepsearch_answer": "KEY_FACTS\n\n<TASK_OUTPUT>\n\nThe probabilistic constraint used to account for the measured posterior probability density function (pdf) in the context of the heaviest observed neutron star mass is given by \n2.0\n𝑀\n⊙\n<\n𝑚\n𝑚\n𝑎\n𝑥\n<\n2.2\n𝑀\n⊙\n2.0M\n⊙\n\t​\n\n<m\nmax\n\t​\n\n<2.2M\n⊙\n\t​\n\n (68 per cent) and \n2.0\n𝑀\n⊙\n<\n𝑚\n𝑚\n𝑎\n𝑥\n<\n2.6\n𝑀\n⊙\n2.0M\n⊙\n\t​\n\n<m\nmax\n\t​\n\n<2.6M\n⊙\n\t​\n\n (90 per cent) [@\"https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/478/1/1377/4987228\"]. </TASK_OUTPUT>\nFINER_DETAILS\n\n<TASK_OUTPUT> The probabilistic constraint used to account for the measured posterior probability density function (pdf) in the context of the heaviest observed neutron star mass is given by \n2.0\n𝑀\n⊙\n<\n𝑚\n𝑚\n𝑎\n𝑥\n<\n2.2\n𝑀\n⊙\n2.0M\n⊙\n\t​\n\n<m\nmax\n\t​\n\n<2.2M\n⊙\n\t​\n\n (68 per cent) and \n2.0\n𝑀\n⊙\n<\n𝑚\n𝑚\n𝑎\n𝑥\n<\n2.6\n𝑀\n⊙\n2.0M\n⊙\n\t​\n\n<m\nmax\n\t​\n\n<2.6M\n⊙\n\t​\n\n (90 per cent) [@\"url:https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/478/1/1377/4987228\"].

Recent studies have reported various findings on the probabilistic constraint for the heaviest observed neutron star mass. For instance, a Bayesian analysis of the maximum mass $M_{TOV}$ of neutron stars with a quark core yielded an absolute upper bound around $2.85 M_{\\odot}$ to the $90\\%$ posterior credible level. Other studies have found maximum masses ranging from $2.08^{+0.07}_{-0.07} M_{\\odot}$ to $2.56^{+0.87}_{-0.58} M_{\\odot}$. The astrophysical implications of using a Bayesian analysis framework with a likelihood function that incorporates various astrophysical and experimental data on the probabilistic constraint for the heaviest observed neutron star mass include constraining the equation of state (EOS) of neutron stars, which determines their properties such as mass, radius, and tidal deformability. The Bayesian refinement of covariant energy density functionals (EDFs) and the implementation of new calibration procedures provide insights into the probabilistic constraint for the heaviest observed neutron star mass.\nREFERENCES\n\n<TASK_OUTPUT>\n\nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/1139644/papers/5456523/files/12728-QM_23_proceedings-2.pdf\nhttps://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/478/1/1377/4987228\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevC.111.015810\nhttps://arxiv.org/html/2408.15192v2\nhttps://inspirehep.net/literature/1625230\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037026932500231X\nhttps://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.110.043013\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56500-x\nhttps://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjc/s10052-021-09806-1\nhttps://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjc/s10052-023-12223-1\nhttps://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2016/07/aa27416-15/aa27416-15.html\nhttps://doi.org/10.3847/2041-8213/adef39\nhttps://doi.org/10.1103/8lv3-1ywb\nhttps://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/acd335/pdf\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/320464476_Constraining_the_Maximum_Mass_of_Neutron_Stars_From_Multi-Messenger_Observations_of_GW170817\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/386677337_Evidence_for_a_maximum_mass_cut-off_in_the_neutron_star_mass_distribution_and_constraints_on_the_equation_of_state\nhttps://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abb4317\nhttps://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017ApJ...850L..19M\nhttps://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017ApJ...850L..19M\nhttps://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018MNRAS.478.1377A/abstract\nhttps://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018MNRAS.478.1377A/abstract\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.18888\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.18888\nhttps://inspirehep.net/literature/2925001\nhttps://inspirehep.net/literature/2925001\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevX.15.021014\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevX.15.021014\nhttps://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023MNRAS.519.2615E/abstract\nhttps://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023MNRAS.519.2615E/abstract\nhttps://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/519/2/2615/6957261\nhttps://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/519/2/2615/6957261\nhttps://inspirehep.net/literature/1887390\nhttps://inspirehep.net/literature/1887390\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.110.063018.pdf\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.110.063018\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/349453124_On_the_Maximum_Mass_of_Neutron_Stars_and_GW190814\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/349453124_On_the_Maximum_Mass_of_Neutron_Stars_and_GW190814\nhttps://iopscience.iop.org/journal/2041-8205/page/Focus_on_NICER_Constraints_on_the_Dense_Matter_Equation_of_State\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.102.064063\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.102.064063\nhttps://arxiv.org/html/2509.07109v1\nhttps://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1968605\nhttps://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/acc4be\nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/1139644/papers/5456523/files/12728-QM_23_proceedings-2.pdf\nhttps://www.epj-conferences.org/articles/epjconf/pdf/2024/06/epjconf_QuarkMatter2023_03002.pdf\nhttps://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023Univ...10....3R/abstract\nhttps://arxiv.org/html/2509.03069v1\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.108.043031\nhttp://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...913...27L/abstract\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0370269324006865\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/643w-c2ly\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevC.107.055803\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/370920715_Bayesian_Analysis_of_Neutron-star_Properties_with_Parameterized_Equations_of_State_The_Role_of_the_Likelihood_Functions\nhttps://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/424/2/1570/1002652\nhttps://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ac447b/epub\nhttps://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/529/4/4650/7634362\nhttps://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/acac1f\nhttps://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024PhRvC.109c5801L/abstract\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevC.109.035801\nhttps://arxiv.org/html/2410.15856v1\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/2075-4434/10/1/16\nhttps://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/532/1/827/7693731\nhttps://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/acac1f/epub\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevC.108.055801 </TASK_OUTPUT>", "marvel_deepsearch_score": 9, "evaluation_model_type": "openai", "evaluation_model_name": "gpt-4o-mini", "qa_model_type": "openai", "qa_model_name": "gpt-4o-mini", "gpt4o_mini_answer_relevancy": 0.92, "gpt4o_mini_answer_correctness": 0.8, "gpt4o_mini_faithfulness": 0.85, "marvel_standard_answer_relevancy": 0.95, "marvel_standard_answer_correctness": 0.3, "marvel_standard_faithfulness": 0.95, "marvel_deepsearch_answer_relevancy": 0.92, "marvel_deepsearch_answer_correctness": 0.82, "marvel_deepsearch_faithfulness": 0.92}

Here’s a structured approach to achieve this:\n\n### 1. **Data Acquisition**\n   - **Collect Late-Time Observations**: Obtain high-quality late-time images of the host galaxies. These images should be taken with the same instrument and under similar conditions to ensure consistency.\n   - **Gather Reference Images**: Acquire reference images of the same fields, ideally taken at an earlier time when the transient event (e.g., supernova) was not present.\n\n### 2. **Image Preprocessing**\n   - **Calibration**: Calibrate the images to correct for instrumental effects, including flat-fielding, bias subtraction, and dark current correction.\n   - **Alignment**: Align the late-time images and reference images to ensure that the same pixels correspond to the same parts of the sky. This may involve using astrometric solutions and image registration techniques.\n\n### 3. **Difference Imaging**\n   - **Create Difference Images**: Subtract the reference images from the late-time images to create difference images. This process highlights transient sources while suppressing the underlying host galaxy light.\n   - **Noise Estimation**: Assess the noise characteristics of the difference images to understand the limits of detection and measurement uncertainties.\n\n### 4. **Source Detection**\n   - **Identify Transients**: Use source detection algorithms (e.g., SExtractor) to identify and extract the transient sources from the difference images.\n   - **Characterize the Host Galaxy**: Ensure that the host galaxy is well-characterized in the difference images, as this will be crucial for accurate photometry.\n\n### 5. **Photometric Measurements**\n   - **Perform Aperture Photometry**: Measure the flux of the transient and the host galaxy using aperture photometry. Choose appropriate aperture sizes to minimize contamination from nearby sources and background noise.\n   - **Use PSF Fitting**: Alternatively, apply point spread function (PSF) fitting techniques to obtain more accurate flux measurements, especially in crowded fields.\n\n### 6. **Background Subtraction**\n   - **Estimate Background**: Carefully estimate and subtract the background level from the photometric measurements to isolate the host galaxy's light.\n   - **Correct for Contamination**: If the transient is still present, ensure that its contribution to the host galaxy's flux is accounted for, either by modeling or by using additional observations.\n\n### 7. **Photometric Calibration**\n   - **Calibrate the Photometry**: Use standard stars or previously calibrated observations to convert the measured fluxes into a standard photometric system (e.g., AB magnitudes).\n   - **Account for Extinction**: Correct for any interstellar extinction that may affect the observed brightness of the host galaxy.\n\n### 8. **Uncertainty Analysis**\n   - **Quantify Uncertainties**: Assess the uncertainties in the photometric measurements, including contributions from noise, calibration errors, and systematic effects.\n   - **Propagation of Errors**: Use error propagation techniques to combine uncertainties from different sources and obtain a final uncertainty for the host galaxy photometry.\n\n### 9. **Data Validation**\n   - **Cross-Check with Other Observations**: Validate the photometric results by comparing them with other observations or catalogs, if available.\n   - **Consistency Checks**: Ensure that the results are consistent across different filters and epochs.\n\n### 10. **Documentation and Reporting**\n   - **Document Methodology**: Clearly document the methodology, including all steps taken, parameters used, and any assumptions made during the analysis.\n   - **Publish Results**: Prepare the results for publication, including detailed descriptions of the data, methods, and findings.\n\nBy following these steps, you can construct a reliable photometry for bright host galaxies using difference images and late-time observation templates, ensuring that the results are robust and scientifically valid.", "gpt4o_mini_score": 9, "marvel_standard_answer": "<QUERY> What are the steps involved in constructing a reliable photometry for bright host galaxies using difference images and late-time observation templates?.

Finally, the pixel likelihoods are combined using weights proportional to the gravitational wave posterior probability for each pixel, resulting in the final $h_0$ posterior for the gravitational wave event.", "gpt4o_mini_answer": "The Hubble constant \\( H_0 \\) is a critical parameter in cosmology that describes the rate of expansion of the universe. One of the innovative methods to estimate \\( H_0 \\) involves the use of gravitational wave (GW) events, particularly those detected by observatories like LIGO and Virgo, in conjunction with electromagnetic (EM) observations of the associated kilonovae or other transient events.\n\nHere's a step-by-step outline of how the likelihood of the Hubble constant \\( h_0 \\) is calculated using gravitational wave localization and pixel analysis:\n\n1. **Gravitational Wave Detection**: When a binary neutron star merger occurs, it produces gravitational waves that can be detected by LIGO and Virgo. The detection provides a signal that can be localized to a certain region of the sky.\n\n2. **Sky Localization**: The gravitational wave signal allows astronomers to determine a \"localization map\" of the sky, which indicates the most probable locations of the source. This is often represented as a probability map overlaid on a celestial sphere, where different regions (pixels) have different probabilities of containing the source.\n\n3. **Electromagnetic Counterpart**: After the GW event, astronomers search for electromagnetic counterparts (like kilonovae) in the localized region. The detection of an EM counterpart provides additional information about the distance to the source.\n\n4. **Distance Measurement**: The distance to the source can be estimated using the observed brightness of the EM counterpart and its known properties (like luminosity). This distance is crucial for calculating \\( H_0 \\).\n\n5. **Pixel Analysis**: The localization map is divided into pixels, each representing a small area of the sky. For each pixel, the likelihood of the GW source being located there is determined based on the GW signal's localization. The distance to the source can be estimated for each pixel based on the EM observations.\n\n6. **Bayesian Inference**: Using Bayesian methods, the likelihood of \\( H_0 \\) can be calculated by combining the distance measurements from the EM counterpart with the prior distribution of \\( H_0 \\). The likelihood function is constructed based on the distances derived from the EM observations and the corresponding pixel probabilities from the GW localization.\n\n7. **Marginalization**: The final step involves marginalizing over the uncertainties in the distance measurements and the GW localization. This results in a posterior distribution for \\( H_0 \\), which reflects the likelihood of different values of the Hubble constant given the observed data.\n\n8. **Result Interpretation**: The posterior distribution can be summarized to provide a best estimate of \\( H_0 \\) along with its uncertainty. This estimate can then be compared with other methods of measuring \\( H_0 \\) (like Cepheid variables or the cosmic microwave background) to assess consistency and potential tensions in cosmological measurements.\n\nIn summary, the calculation of the likelihood of the Hubble constant \\( h_0 \\) using gravitational wave localization and pixel analysis involves a combination of GW signal localization, EM counterpart observations, distance measurements, and Bayesian statistical methods to derive a posterior distribution for \\( H_0 \\).

Specifically, it can improve the precision of \n𝐻\n0\nH\n0\n\t​\n\n measurements, offer a \n30\n%\n30% accuracy improvement on the measurement of the Hubble constant using a three power-law mass model (3PL), constrain the Hubble constant with a precision of \n15\n%\n15% or less using a novel Bayesian method, and reduce the computational cost and bias due to estimating the detection probability from a fiducial population.\n\nThe initial value of the Hubble constant obtained from this method is \n70\n70 kilometers per second per megaparsec [https://news.uchicago.edu/story/how-use-gravitational-waves-measure-expansion-universe]. The most recent study on this topic is Document6, which presents a novel Bayesian method for inferring the Hubble constant from the cross-correlation of individual gravitational wave events with galaxies. This method is expected to provide a more precise estimate of the Hubble constant within five years.\n\nThe implications of pixelated galaxy catalog incompleteness on the precision of Hubble constant \nℎ\n0\nh\n0\n\t​\n\n measurements using gravitational wave localization are significant. Incompleteness can lead to biased measurements of \n𝐻\n0\nH\n0\n\t​\n\n. However, advanced methodologies that account for directional dependence of galaxy catalog completeness have been developed. These methods improve the precision of \n𝐻\n0\nH\n0\n\t​\n\n measurements by carrying out inferences on a pixel-by-pixel basis.\n\nThe likelihood of the Hubble constant \n𝐻\n0\nH\n0\n\t​\n\n can be calculated using gravitational wave localization and pixel analysis through various methods, including Bayesian analysis and pixelated approaches. These methods have been used to estimate \n𝐻\n0\nH\n0\n\t​\n\n with varying degrees of precision, and further measurements are expected to provide a more precise estimate of the Hubble constant within five years.\n\nThe initial value of the Hubble constant obtained from this method is \n70\n70 kilometers per second per megaparsec [https://news.uchicago.edu/story/how-use-gravitational-waves-measure-expansion-universe]. The implications of pixelated galaxy catalog incompleteness on the precision of Hubble constant \nℎ\n0\nh\n0\n\t​\n\n measurements using gravitational wave localization are that it affects the accuracy and precision.

Understanding these parameters is crucial for accurately determining the kilonova properties and the production of heavy elements in neutron star mergers.\n\nReferences\n\n[1] https://arxiv.org/html/2404.15027v2 [2] https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/449/1/390/1303023 [3] https://dipot.ulb.ac.be/dspace/bitstream/2013/337495/3/Just22_mnras510_2820.pdf [4] https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/529/2/1333/7612992 [5] https://onlinellibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/andp.202200306 [6] https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/523/2/2551/7163222 [7] https://www.researchgate.net/figure/The-approach-to-homologous-expansion-is-shown-by-comparing-the-velocity-profiles-of-model_fig7_316075760 [8] https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.5.013168 [9] https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/acac29 [10] https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2009/06/aa10292-08/aa10292-08.html [11] https://laro.lanl.gov/view/pdfCoverPage?instCode=01LANL_INST&filePid=13162535850003761&download=true [12] https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad1036 [13] https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/533/2/2096/7737662 [14] https://www.osti.gov/pages/biblio/2280715 [15] https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.04363 </FINAL_DETAILED_REPORT>", "marvel_deepsearch_score": 4, "evaluation_model_type": "openai", "evaluation_model_name": "gpt-4o-mini", "qa_model_type": "openai", "qa_model_name": "gpt-4o-mini", "gpt4o_mini_answer_relevancy": 0.95, "gpt4o_mini_answer_correctness": 0.7, "gpt4o_mini_faithfulness": 0.05, "marvel_standard_answer_relevancy": 0.98, "marvel_standard_answer_correctness": 0.6, "marvel_standard_faithfulness": 0.98, "marvel_deepsearch_answer_relevancy": 0.87, "marvel_deepsearch_answer_correctness": 0.73, "marvel_deepsearch_faithfulness": 0.82}

Studies have focused on the distribution of chirp masses from observed events to understand the population of binary black holes.\n\n2. **Lognormal Fit**: A lognormal distribution is often used to model the chirp mass distribution because it can effectively capture the skewness and the range of values observed in the data. The lognormal fit suggests that the chirp mass distribution is not uniform and may have a characteristic scale and spread, indicating that there are preferred mass ranges for binary black holes.\n\n3. **Bayesian Evidence**: Bayesian evidence is a statistical measure used to compare different models based on how well they explain the observed data. In the context of black hole mergers, Bayesian evidence can help determine whether a lognormal distribution is a better fit compared to other models (e.g., uniform or Gaussian distributions). A higher Bayesian evidence value for the lognormal model would suggest that it is more consistent with the observed chirp mass data.\n\n4. **Findings**: The findings from these analyses typically indicate that the chirp mass distribution of binary black holes is best described by a lognormal distribution, with specific parameters that reflect the observed population.

Alternatively, it can indicate the corotation radius of the binary black hole system, which is crucial for understanding the gravitational torque exerted by the circumbinary disc on the binary (Source: https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2012/09/aa19986-12/aa19986-12.html).\n</ANSWER>\n\n# Understanding the Vertical Dashed Line in 2D Torque Maps: Insights into Binary Black Hole Snapshots and Gravitational Torque Contributions\n\nThe vertical dashed line in 2D torque maps is a significant feature that indicates various aspects of binary black hole (BH) snapshots and their contributions to gravitational torque. This article aims to synthesize information from multiple sources to provide a comprehensive understanding of what the vertical dashed line signifies.\n\n## Indications of the Vertical Dashed Line\n\nThe vertical dashed line in 2D torque maps often marks specific points or regions related to binary black hole systems. According to [https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/524/2/2770/7218574](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/524/2/2770/7218574), the vertical dashed lines indicate the position of binary black holes (BHs) in the snapshot, which have the strongest contributions to the gravitational torque.\n\nIn another context, [https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ac60fd](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ac60fd) mentions that the vertical dashed line in the 2D torque map indicates three torquing regions that contribute to the gravitational torque on the binary black hole (BBH) snapshot. These regions are crucial for understanding how the gravitational torque affects the BBH.\n\n## Corotation Radius and Gravitational Torque\n\nThe corotation radius is another critical aspect marked by the vertical dashed line. As noted in [https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2012/09/aa19986-12/aa19986-12.html](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2012/09/aa19986-12/aa19986-12.html), the vertical dashed line indicates the corotation radius of the binary black hole system. This radius is pivotal because it is the location where the orbital period of the binary matches the rotation period of the disc. The net gravity torque changes sign across the BHB corotation radius, implying that it plays a crucial role in determining the binary's evolution, particularly in how it interacts with the circumbinary disc.\n\n## Specific Time Points and Torquing Regions\n\nIn some cases, the vertical dashed line marks a specific time point. For instance, [https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/531/4/4656/7691264](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/531/4/4656/7691264) references a time point at $t = 39.6$, related to the snapshot of the binary black hole and the contributions to gravitational torque.\n\n## Energy Deposition and Common Envelope Evolution\n\nThe vertical dashed line can also be associated with energy deposition during common envelope evolution (CEE). According to [https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2023/06/aa46057-23/aa46057-23.html](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2023/06/aa46057-23/aa46057-23.html), a change related to the replacement of the averaged binary potential with its full expression leads to a bump in energy, associated with a gravitational energy deposition during the CEE of $\\sim46\\%$ of the difference between the initial and final total orbital energy.\n\n## Eccentricity and Snapshot Representation\n\nAdditionally, [https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada612](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada612) mentions that vertical white dotted-dashed lines in the 2D torque map mark the binary eccentricity.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the vertical dashed line in 2D torque maps indicates a variety of significant aspects regarding binary black hole snapshots and their contributions to gravitational torque, including positions of binary black holes, torquing regions, corotation radius, specific time points, energy deposition, and more. Understanding these indications is crucial for comprehending the complex interactions within binary black hole systems and their circumbinary discs.\n\n## References\n\n- [https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/524/2/2770/7218574](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/524/2/2770/7218574)\n- [https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ac60fd](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ac60fd)\n- [https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/531/4/4656/7691264](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/531/4/4656/7691264)\n- [https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2023/06/aa46057-23/aa46057-23.html](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2023/06/aa46057-23/aa46057-23.html)\n- [https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2012/09/aa19986-12/aa19986-12.html](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2012/09/aa19986-12/aa19986-12.html)\n- [https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada612](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada612)\n- [https://www.researchgate.net/figure/A-series-of-snapshots-of-the-disk-surface-density-at-different-times-Density-contours_fig1_51948100](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/A-series-of-snapshots-of-the-disk-surface-density-at-different-times-Density-contours_fig1_51948100)\n- [https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/755/1/51](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/755/1/51)", "marvel_standard_score": 7, "marvel_deepsearch_answer": "KEY_FACTS\n\n<TASK_OUTPUT>\n\nThe vertical dashed line in the 2D torque map indicates the position of binary black holes in the snapshot with the strongest contributions to gravitational torque [@\"url:https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/524/2/2770/7218574\"].\nIt signifies that the strongest contribution to gravitational torque comes from the gas close to individual black holes, with the main source of torque arising from the structure at the orbital radius of the binary [@\"url:https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ac60fd\"].\nThe line indicates the corotation radius of the binary black hole system, a critical radius where the net gravity torque changes sign, and all torques are null [@\"url:https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2012/09/aa19986-12/aa19986-12.html\"].\nThe total torque is calculated by integrating from the corotation radius inwards (〈T1,0〉, binary region) and outwards (〈T1,∞〉, disc region) [@\"url:https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2023/06/aa46057-23/aa46057-23.html\"].\nThe vertical dashed line implies a positive contribution to the torque at a separation from the black hole, influencing the gravitational torque exerted by the circumbinary disc on the binary black hole system at different radii.\nThe vertical dashed line in the 2D torque map indicates three torquing regions that contribute to the gravitational torque on the binary black hole (BBH) snapshot [@\"url:https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ac60fd\"].\nVertical white dotted-dashed lines in the 2D torque map mark the binary eccentricity [@\"url:https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada612\"].\nThe vertical dashed line can also be associated with energy deposition during common envelope evolution (CEE) [@\"url:https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2023/06/aa46057-23/aa46057-23.html\"]. </TASK_OUTPUT>\nFINER_DETAILS\n\n<TASK_OUTPUT> The vertical dashed line in the 2D torque map indicates significant aspects of binary black hole (BH) snapshots and their contributions to gravitational torque.

According to multiple sources, the vertical dashed line can signify:\n\nPosition of Binary Black Holes: The vertical dashed lines indicate the position of binary black holes (BHs) in the snapshot, which have the strongest contributions to the gravitational torque [https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/524/2/2770/7218574].\n\nTorquing Regions: The vertical dashed line in the 2D torque map indicates three torquing regions that contribute to the gravitational torque on the binary black hole (BBH) snapshot [https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ac60fd].\n\nCorotation Radius: The vertical dashed line indicates the corotation radius of the binary black hole system. This radius is pivotal because it is the location where the orbital period of the binary matches the rotation period of the disc. The net gravity torque changes sign across the BHB corotation radius, implying that it plays a crucial role in determining the binary's evolution, particularly in how it interacts with the circumbinary disc [https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2012/09/aa19986-12/aa19986-12.html].\n\nSpecific Time Points: In some cases, the vertical dashed line marks a specific time point related to the snapshot of the binary black hole and the contributions to gravitational torque. For instance, a time point at \n𝑡\n=\n39.6\nt=39.6 is referenced [https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/531/4/4656/7691264].\n\nEnergy Deposition and Common Envelope Evolution: The vertical dashed line can also be associated with energy deposition during common envelope evolution (CEE).

This line signifies that the strongest contribution to gravitational torque comes from the gas close to individual BHs. The main source of torque arises from the structure at the orbital radius of the binary. The vertical dashed line can also indicate the corotation radius of the binary black hole system.

The total torque is calculated by integrating from this point inwards (〈T1,0〉, binary region) and outwards (〈T1,∞〉, disc region). The physical implication of the vertical dashed line in the 2D torque map is that it indicates a positive contribution to the torque at a separation from the black hole. This implies that the main source of torque arises from the structure at the orbital radius of the binary, influencing the gravitational torque exerted by the circumbinary disc on the binary black hole system at different radii.\n\nReferences\nhttps://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/524/2/2770/7218574\nhttps://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ac60fd\nhttps://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/531/4/4656/7691264\nhttps://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2023/06/aa46057-23/aa46057-23.html\nhttps://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2012/09/aa19986-12/aa19986-12.html\nhttps://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada612\nhttps://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2212.06133.pdf\nhttps://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/528/2/2358/7521320 </TASK_OUTPUT>\nREFERENCES\n\n<TASK_OUTPUT>\n\nhttps://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/524/2/2770/7218574\nhttps://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ac60fd\nhttps://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2012/09/aa19986-12/aa19986-12.html\nhttps://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2212.06133.pdf\nhttps://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/531/4/4656/7691264\nhttps://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ac9185/pdf\nhttps://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/528/2/2358/7521320\nhttps://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2023/06/aa46057-23/aa46057-23.html\nhttps://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada612\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/figure/A-series-of-snapshots-of-the-disk-surface-density-at-different-times-Density-contours_fig1_51948100\nhttps://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/755/1/51 </TASK_OUTPUT>", "marvel_deepsearch_score": 9, "evaluation_model_type": "openai", "evaluation_model_name": "gpt-4o-mini", "qa_model_type": "openai", "qa_model_name": "gpt-4o-mini", "gpt4o_mini_answer_relevancy": 0.92, "gpt4o_mini_answer_correctness": 0.82, "gpt4o_mini_faithfulness": 0.82, "marvel_standard_answer_relevancy": 0.85, "marvel_standard_answer_correctness": 0.8, "marvel_standard_faithfulness": 0.95, "marvel_deepsearch_answer_relevancy": 0.92, "marvel_deepsearch_answer_correctness": 0.87, "marvel_deepsearch_faithfulness": 0.92}

The equation that describes the TDE radius in relation to the mass of a supermassive black hole, the mass of a binary black hole, and the semi-major axis of the binary black hole's orbit is complex and has been studied extensively in various research papers.\n\n## Definition of Tidal Disruption Event Radius\nThe tidal disruption event radius can be defined by the equation $R_{\\rm T}\\approx r_{\\star}\\left(\\frac{M_{\\rm BH}}{m_{\\star}}\\right)^{1/3}$ [1], where $R_{\\rm T}$ is the tidal disruption radius, $r_{\\star}$ is the radius of the star, $M_{\\rm BH}$ is the mass of the black hole, and $m_{\\star}$ is the mass of the star.\n\n## Relation to Supermassive Black Hole and Binary Black Hole\nThe tidal disruption event radius can also be related to the mass of a supermassive black hole, the mass of a binary black hole, and the semi-major axis of the binary black hole's orbit through various equations. For example, [2] provides the equation $10^{-4} \\leq a/r_h \\leq1$, where $a$ is the semi-major axis of the binary black hole's orbit and $r_h$ is the tidal disruption event radius.\n\n## Equations for Tidal Disruption Event Radius\nSeveral equations have been proposed to describe the tidal disruption event radius, including [3]:\n$r_t = r_∗(M_{BH} /m ∗)1/3$, and more specifically, $r t1 ≈4.6 pc(3 − γ )M7σ −2100$\n\n## Tidal Disruption Radius in Newtonian Gravity\nIn Newtonian gravity, the tidal disruption radius $R_t$ for a star of mass $M_{\\star}$ and radius $R_{\\star}$ around a massive black hole of mass $M_{BH}$ is approximately given by $R_t = R_{\\star} $\\left($ $\\frac{M_{BH}}{M_{\\star}}$ $\\right)^{1/3}$ [4].\n\n## General Relativity and Affine Models\nFor a Schwarzschild or Kerr metric SMBH, the effective tidal disruption radius $R_{GR}$ can be estimated as $R_{GR} = R_{\\star} $\\left($ $\\frac{M_{BH}}{M_{\\star}}$ $\\right)^{1/3}$ $\\left($ $\\frac{\\Lambda_1}{G$ M_{BH}/r^3} $\\right)^{1/3}$ [4].\n\n## Binary Black Hole Systems\nThe tidal disruption event radius in binary black hole systems can be described by equations such as $R_t \\equiv a(M^3/m_{12})^{1/3}$ [5], where $a$ is the semi-major axis of the binary black hole's orbit, $M$ is the mass of the supermassive black hole, and $m_{12}$ is the mass of the binary black hole.\n\n## Conclusion\nIn conclusion, the equation that describes the tidal disruption event radius in relation to the mass of a supermassive black hole, the mass of a binary black hole, and the semi-major axis of the binary black hole's orbit is complex and depends on various factors.

Wilson coefficients parameterize the strength of various operators in these effective theories. For example, they can encode information about the interactions between black holes and other fields, such as gravitational waves or matter fields.\n\n2. **Classical Limits**: When considering the classical limit of black holes, one often looks at the behavior of black holes in terms of their classical properties, such as mass, charge, and angular momentum. The Wilson coefficients can help bridge the gap between quantum descriptions and classical behavior, particularly in the context of spin interactions. For instance, in the study of spinning black holes (Kerr black holes), the Wilson coefficients can provide insights into how the spin affects the dynamics and stability of the black hole.\n\n3. **Scattering Amplitudes**: In the context of scattering processes involving black holes, Wilson coefficients can be computed from scattering amplitudes. They can provide information about the effective interactions that arise when considering the exchange of virtual particles in the vicinity of a black hole.\n\n### Computation of Wilson Coefficients\n\nThe computation of Wilson coefficients typically involves several steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Effective Theory**: Start by identifying the effective field theory that describes the system of interest. This could be a low-energy effective theory that captures the relevant degrees of freedom around a black hole.\n\n2. **Perturbative Calculations**: Use perturbative techniques to compute scattering amplitudes or correlation functions in the effective theory. This often involves Feynman diagrams and the application of quantum field theory techniques.\n\n3. **Renormalization**: The Wilson coefficients are often determined through the process of renormalization, where divergences in the theory are handled, and physical quantities are expressed in terms of finite parameters. The coefficients can be extracted from the renormalized operators in the effective theory.\n\n4. **Matching Conditions**: In some cases, Wilson coefficients can be computed by matching the effective theory to a more fundamental theory (like string theory or general relativity) at a certain energy scale. This involves ensuring that the predictions of the effective theory agree with those of the fundamental theory in a certain limit.\n\n5. **Classical Limit**: Finally, to connect the quantum results to classical black hole physics, one often takes the classical limit of the effective theory, which may involve taking certain parameters (like Planck's constant) to zero or considering large mass limits.\n\nIn summary, Wilson coefficients are significant in the study of black holes as they encapsulate the strength of interactions in effective field theories, bridging quantum and classical descriptions.

The significance of the Wilson coefficient lies in its ability to reproduce the potential for the Kerr black hole and to model non-conservative effects exhibited by Kerr black holes. The effects of setting the Wilson coefficients to unity are: the minimum entanglement entropy is at \nΔ\n𝑆\n≈\n1.26\n×\n10\n−\n8\nΔS≈1.26×10\n−8\n and corresponds to the Wilson coefficient value \n(\n𝐶\n2\n;\n𝐶\n3\n)\n=\n(\n1\n;\n1\n)\n(C\n2\n\t​\n\n;C\n3\n\t​\n\n)=(1;1), and the deformation of each Wilson coefficient away from unity raises the entanglement entropy, with the effect of \n𝐶\n2\nC\n2\n\t​\n\n being dominant.

Furthermore, the Wilson coefficient can be understood in several ways: reproduction of Kerr black hole potential, cancellation of finite-spin deviations, and parameterization of couplings. The on-shell formalism, Hilbert space matching procedure, and matching to black hole perturbation theory are approaches used to compute the Wilson coefficient. The study of spinning objects in general relativity and electrodynamics is also related to the computation of the Wilson coefficient.

The Wilson coefficients play a crucial role in describing non-conservative effects exhibited by Kerr black holes beyond a certain order in spin, specifically up to fourth order in the spins of either black hole, as discussed in a study by R Aoude, published in 2024 @\"url:https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.109.036007\" and @\"url:https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.109.064058\". Additionally, the Wilson coefficients relate to the effective field theory (EFT) framework as essential parameters that describe the behavior of spinning black holes beyond the classical-spin limit. They are determined through matching processes, such as computing scattering amplitudes and matching them to Teukolsky solutions, and are crucial for predicting observables like gravitational waveforms. The EFT framework, by including these coefficients, provides a systematic way to study spinning black holes, especially in contexts like black hole binary dynamics and the post-Newtonian expansion.

Deformation of these coefficients away from unity increases the entanglement entropy, with \n𝐶\n2\nC\n2\n\t​\n\n having a comparatively dominant effect.\n\nThe Wilson coefficient is significant in the context of black holes and classical-spin limits. Its computation involves a deep understanding of the behavior of spinning black holes and their interactions with other objects. The significance of the Wilson coefficient lies in its ability to reproduce the potential for the Kerr black hole and to model non-conservative effects exhibited by Kerr black holes.\n\nReferences\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.08463.pdf\nhttps://arxiv.org/html/2312.04513v1\nhttps://scoap3-prod-backend.s3.cern.ch/media/files/57796/10.1103/PhysRevLett.125.181602.pdf\nhttps://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/JHEP09(2020)074\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.125.181602\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.109.036007\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.109.064058\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.08917.pdf\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.21090.pdf\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.01430.pdf\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0370157316300370\nhttps://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/JHEP03(2024)108\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.109.045011\nhttps://arxiv.org/html/2411.17893v1\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.104.065014\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2111.02072\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/271218982_An_effective_field_theory_for_gravitating_spinning_objects_in_the_post-Newtonian_scheme.pdf\nhttps://www.bohrium.com/paper-details/effective-field-theory-for-the-perturbations-of-a-slowly-rotating-black-hole/867750034613993686-108495\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/386211038_Ringdown_Analysis_of_Rotating_Black_Holes_in_Effective_Field_Theory_Extensions_of_General_Relativity\nhttps://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/JHEP09(2020)074\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.08463.pdf\nhttps://arxiv.org/html/2312.04513v1\nhttps://scoap3-prod-backend.s3.cern.ch/media/files/57796/10.1103/PhysRevLett.125.181602.pdf\nhttps://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/JHEP09(2020)074\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.125.181602\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.109.036007\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.109.064058\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.08917.pdf\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.21090.pdf\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.01430.pdf\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0370157316300370\nhttps://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/JHEP03(2024)108\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.109.045011\nhttps://arxiv.org/html/2411.17893v1\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.104.065014\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2111.02072\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/271218982_An_effective_field_theory_for_gravitating_spinning_objects_in_the_post-Newtonian_scheme.pdf\nhttps://www.bohrium.com/paper-details/effective-field-theory-for-the-perturbations-of-a-slowly-rotating-black-hole/867750034613993686-108495\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/386211038_Ringdown_Analysis_of_Rotating_Black_Holes_in_Effective_Field_Theory_Extensions_of_General_Relativity\nhttps://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/JHEP09(2020)074\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.08463.pdf\nhttps://arxiv.org/html/2312.04513v1\nhttps://scoap3-prod-backend.s3.cern.ch/media/files/57796/10.1103/PhysRevLett.125.181602.pdf\nhttps://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/JHEP09(2020)074\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.125.181602\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.109.036007\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.109.064058\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.08917.pdf\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.21090.pdf\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.01430.pdf\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0370157316300370\nhttps://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/JHEP03(2024)108\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.109.045011\nhttps://arxiv.org/html/2411.17893v1\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.104.065014\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2111.02072\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/271218982_An_effective_field_theory_for_gravitating_spinning_objects_in_the_post-Newtonian_scheme.pdf\nhttps://www.bohrium.com/paper-details/effective-field-theory-for-the-perturbations-of-a-slowly-rotating-black-hole/867750034613993686-108495\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/386211038_Ringdown_Analysis_of_Rotating_Black_Holes_in_Effective_Field_Theory_Extensions_of_General_Relativity\nhttps://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/JHEP09(2020)074\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.08463.pdf\nhttps://arxiv.org/html/2312.04513v1\nhttps://scoap3-prod-backend.s3.cern.ch/media/files/57796/10.1103/PhysRevLett.125.181602.pdf\nhttps://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/JHEP09(2020)074\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.125.181602\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.109.036007\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.109.064058\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.08917.pdf\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.21090.pdf\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.01430.pdf\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0370157316300370\nhttps://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/JHEP03(2024)108\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.109.045011\nhttps://arxiv.org/html/2411.17893v1\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.104.065014\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2111.02072\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/271218982_An_effective_field_theory_for_gravitating_spinning_objects_in_the_post-Newtonian_scheme.pdf\nhttps://www.bohrium.com/paper-details/effective-field-theory-for-the-per

The mass transfer process directly influences the evolution of the stars, particularly in stripping the envelope of the primary star and affecting the final fate of the compact remnants.", "gpt4o_mini_answer": "The evolution of a binary system leading to a double compact-object merger, such as a binary neutron star (BNS) or binary black hole (BBH) system, involves several key steps. These steps are influenced by the mass transfer process and the interactions between the stars in the binary system. Here’s a general outline of the process:\n\n### 1. Formation of the Binary System\n- **Initial Conditions**: The binary system typically starts with two massive stars that form from the same molecular cloud. Their initial masses are usually above a certain threshold (around 8-10 solar masses) to eventually evolve into compact objects (neutron stars or black holes).\n- **Orbital Dynamics**: The stars are in a close binary orbit, which is crucial for the subsequent evolution.\n\n### 2. Stellar Evolution\n- **Main Sequence Phase**: Both stars evolve on the main sequence, burning hydrogen in their cores. Their masses and radii change over time.\n- **Mass Transfer Initiation**: As the more massive star exhausts its hydrogen fuel, it expands into a red supergiant. If the stars are close enough, this can lead to the first phase of mass transfer, where the outer layers of the more massive star are transferred to the companion star.\n\n### 3. Mass Transfer and Its Effects\n- **Case A Mass Transfer**: If the mass transfer occurs while the donor star is still on the main sequence, it can lead to significant changes in both stars. The mass gain can rejuvenate the companion star, allowing it to evolve more quickly.\n- **Case B and C Mass Transfer**: If the mass transfer occurs after the donor has evolved off the main sequence (Case B) or after it has become a compact object (Case C), the dynamics change. The mass transfer can lead to the formation of an accretion disk around the companion star, affecting its evolution and potentially leading to further mass loss.\n\n### 4. Formation of Compact Objects\n- **Supernova Events**: The more massive star eventually undergoes a supernova explosion, leaving behind a neutron star or black hole. The mass transfer process can alter the mass and spin of the remaining star.\n- **Second Supernova**: The second star will also evolve and eventually undergo a supernova, leading to the formation of a second compact object.\n\n### 5. Orbital Evolution\n- **Angular Momentum Loss**: The mass transfer process can lead to the loss of angular momentum from the binary system, causing the orbit to shrink. This is particularly true if the mass transfer is stable and leads to the formation of an accretion disk.\n- **Gravitational Wave Emission**: As the stars lose mass and the orbit shrinks, they emit gravitational waves, which further accelerates the inspiral process.\n\n### 6. Merger\n- **Final Inspiral**: As the two compact objects spiral closer together due to gravitational wave emission, they eventually reach a point where they can no longer maintain their separation.\n- **Merger Event**: The two compact objects merge, resulting in a variety of outcomes depending on their masses and types (e.g., a more massive black hole, a kilonova event in the case of neutron stars).\n\n### Summary\nThe mass transfer process in a binary system significantly influences the evolution of the stars involved, affecting their masses, lifetimes, and the dynamics of the binary system. The combination of stellar evolution, mass transfer, and gravitational wave emission ultimately leads to the merger of double compact objects within the Hubble time.

Gravitational-wave detectors, such as LIGO and Virgo, rely on the interference of laser light to detect minute changes in distance caused by passing gravitational waves. The optical elements in these interferometers, such as mirrors and beam splitters, are typically made from materials that can absorb some of the laser light, leading to heating and subsequent thermal fluctuations.\n\n### Key Points on the Photo-Thermal Effect and Thermal Noise:\n\n1. **Photo-Thermal Effect**: When laser light is absorbed by the optical elements, it generates heat due to the conversion of light energy into thermal energy. This heating can cause the material to expand or change its refractive index, leading to fluctuations in the optical path length.\n\n2. **Thermal Noise**: The thermal noise in optical elements arises from the random motion of atoms and molecules in the material due to thermal energy. This noise manifests as fluctuations in the position and shape of the mirrors and other components, which can affect the precision of the measurements.\n\n3. **Impact on Sensitivity**: The presence of thermal noise limits the ability of gravitational-wave detectors to measure very small changes in distance (on the order of \\(10^{-21}\\) meters). As the sensitivity of these detectors is pushed to its limits, understanding and mitigating thermal noise becomes crucial.\n\n4. **Material Selection and Design**: To minimize the effects of the photo-thermal effect and thermal noise, researchers carefully select materials with low absorption coefficients and high thermal conductivity. Additionally, designs may incorporate features such as coatings that reduce absorption or active cooling systems to manage temperature fluctuations.\n\n5. **Modeling and Compensation**: The photo-thermal effect can be modeled to predict its impact on the interferometer's performance. Compensation techniques, such as feedback control systems, can be implemented to counteract the effects of thermal noise.\n\nIn summary, the photo-thermal effect is a critical factor in the performance of gravitational-wave interferometers, as it directly contributes to thermal noise in optical elements.

The parameter \\( z_* \\) typically characterizes the scale at which non-local effects become significant. This parameter can be thought of as a measure of the \"size\" of the non-locality in the theory, influencing how fields interact over distances that are not strictly local.\n\nThe Kuz'min form factor is a specific type of form factor used in the context of non-local interactions. It is often employed to model the effects of non-locality in a way that is mathematically tractable. The Kuz'min form factor can be expressed in terms of a power series, which allows for a systematic expansion of the non-local effects in terms of a small parameter.

These models differ primarily in their mechanisms for generating the axion mass and the associated anomaly terms.\n\n### KSVZ Models:\n1. **Mechanism for Axion Mass**: In KSVZ models, the axion is introduced as a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson arising from the spontaneous breaking of a global U(1) symmetry. The axion mass is generated through non-perturbative effects, such as instanton effects in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The mass is proportional to the QCD scale and the axion decay constant.\n\n2. **Anomaly Terms**: KSVZ models typically introduce additional heavy quarks that couple to the axion field. These heavy quarks do not contribute to the ordinary quark content of the Standard Model but are essential for generating the axion's coupling to the gluon field through the anomaly. The axion couples to the gluon field strength tensor via a term that is proportional to the product of the axion field and the gluon field strength, leading to the axion's role in canceling the QCD anomaly.\n\n### DFSZ Models:\n1. **Mechanism for Axion Mass**: DFSZ models also introduce the axion as a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson from a U(1) symmetry breaking. However, in these models, the axion is coupled directly to the Standard Model quarks and leptons. The axion mass is similarly generated through non-perturbative QCD effects, but the coupling to the Standard Model particles is more direct, involving the Higgs field.\n\n2. **Anomaly Terms**: In DFSZ models, the axion couples to both the quarks and the leptons through the Higgs mechanism. This means that the axion's interactions are more integrated with the Standard Model's particle content, leading to a different structure of the anomaly terms. The axion's coupling to the gluons is still present, but it arises from the interactions with the Higgs field and the quark content of the model.\n\n### Summary of Differences:\n- **KSVZ**: Introduces additional heavy quarks to generate the axion mass and anomaly terms; axion couples to gluons through these heavy quarks.\n- **DFSZ**: Directly couples the axion to the Standard Model quarks and leptons via the Higgs field; axion mass and anomaly terms arise from these couplings.\n\nThese differences lead to distinct phenomenological implications for axion detection and interactions, influencing experimental searches for axions in various contexts.", "gpt4o_mini_score": 9, "marvel_standard_answer": "The two main types of models in axion physics are the DFSZ (Dine-Fischler-Srednicki-Zhitshlowsky) and KSVZ (Kim-Shifman-Vainshtein-Zakharov) models.

These models differ in their mechanisms for generating the axion mass and anomaly terms, which in turn affect their predictions of different types of couplings between axions and other particles.\n\nThe KSVZ model primarily couples axions to heavy quarks with minimal tree-level couplings to Standard Model fermions, while the DFSZ model connects axions to Standard Model quarks and leptons via Higgs bosons, leading to significant tree-level couplings to fermions like electrons. These differences stem from the distinct ultraviolet origins and Peccei-Quinn charge assignments in the two models.\n\nThe implications of the axion's couplings to heavy quarks in the Kim-Shifman-Vainshtein-Zakharov (KSVZ) model versus its couplings to Standard Model quarks and leptons via Higgs bosons in the Dine-Fischler-Srednicki-Zhitnitsky (DFSZ) model on the axion's phenomenology are significant. The KSVZ model, where new heavy quarks carry U(1)PQ charges, leaves ordinary quarks and leptons without tree-level axion couplings. In contrast, the DFSZ model, which requires at least two Higgs doublets and ordinary quarks and leptons carrying PQ charges, predicts different axion couplings and phenomenology.

The maximum distance at which the CWB algorithm can detect gravitational waves with a certain efficiency, such as 10%, depends on several factors, including the sensitivity of the gravitational wave detectors (like LIGO and Virgo), the frequency of the gravitational waves, and the characteristics of the source.\n\nAs of my last knowledge update in October 2023, the typical range for detecting gravitational waves with current detectors like LIGO and Virgo is on the order of hundreds of megaparsecs (Mpc) for binary black hole mergers and neutron star mergers, with ranges varying based on the specific event and the detector's sensitivity at different frequencies. For example, LIGO has been able to detect events from distances up to about 1 billion light-years (approximately 300 Mpc) for the most massive binary black hole mergers.\n\nIn contrast, neutrino detectors, such as IceCube or Super-Kamiokande, have a much different detection range due to the nature of neutrinos, which interact very weakly with matter. The effective range of neutrino detectors can vary widely depending on the type of neutrino source and the energy of the neutrinos. For example, IceCube can detect high-energy neutrinos from astrophysical sources, but the effective range is typically much smaller than that of gravitational wave detectors, often on the order of tens to hundreds of kiloparsecs (kpc) for certain sources, depending on the energy and the specific detection capabilities.\n\nIn summary, while the CWB algorithm can detect gravitational waves from distances of hundreds of Mpc with reasonable efficiency, neutrino detectors generally have a much shorter effective range, often limited to tens to hundreds of kpc for specific high-energy events.

The coherent WaveBurst (cWB) pipeline, a model-agnostic algorithm, is used to search for GW transients.\n\n## Detection Efficiency and Distance\n\nThe maximum distance at which the cWB algorithm can detect gravitational waves with 10% efficiency is reported to be $40.7$ kpc [1].

For neutrino-driven explosions, the distance at which 50% detection efficiency is reached is up to $8.9$ kpc, while more energetic magnetorotationally-driven explosions are detectable at larger distances [2]. A direct comparison to the typical range of currently operating neutrino detectors, such as Super-Kamiokande, LVD, and KamLAND, is not provided, but this information might be found in the source document or related literature.\n\n## Efficiency Curves and Multi-Messenger Analysis\n\nThe efficiency curves represent the ratio of the number of recovered injections with a false alarm rate (FAR) threshold to the total number of injections performed for each distance [3]. The multi-messenger FAR associated with “CCSN candidates” is calculated, and a threshold on FAR of 1/1000 years is applied. The improvement in detection efficiency using a 2-parameter method versus the standard one is also discussed, with the efficiency for KamLAND to identify a signal at 60 kpc improved from 73% to 83% [3].\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the cWB algorithm can detect gravitational waves from CCSN with 10% efficiency at a maximum distance of $40.7$ kpc.

Lee, C.N. Yang, and R. Foot. Their work has led to a deeper understanding of the fundamental forces of nature and the properties of dark matter.\n\n## History of Weak Interactions and Parity Violation\n\nIn 1956, T.D. Lee and C.N. Yang postulated that parity symmetry might be broken by the weak interaction [1]. They suggested experimental tests, which were conducted within a year, confirming their conjecture and changing a core paradigm of physics [2]. Their work challenged the long-held assumption that the laws of Nature are parity invariant.\n\nThe parity transformation $P$ in quantum mechanics changes the sign of the three spatial coordinates, $\\vec{r} \\to -\\vec{r}$. Lee and Yang found an indication that parity symmetry was broken in the weak interaction, which causes radioactive decay [3].\n\n## Mirror Dark Matter\n\nMirror dark matter, also known as shadow matter or alice matter, mirrors the properties of ordinary matter but interacts with it only via gravity or weak interaction [4].

Lee, C.N. Yang, and R. Foot. Their work has led to a deeper understanding of the fundamental forces of nature and the properties of dark matter.\n\nHistory of Weak Interactions and Parity Violation\n\nIn 1956, T.D. Lee and C.N. Yang postulated that parity symmetry might be broken by the weak interaction [1]. They suggested experimental tests, which were conducted within a year, confirming their conjecture and changing a core paradigm of physics [2]. Their work challenged the long-held assumption that the laws of Nature are parity invariant.\n\nThe parity transformation \n𝑃\nP in quantum mechanics changes the sign of the three spatial coordinates, \n𝑟\n⃗\n→\n−\n𝑟\n⃗\nr\n→−\nr\n. Lee and Yang found an indication that parity symmetry was broken in the weak interaction, which causes radioactive decay [3].\n\nMirror Dark Matter\n\nMirror dark matter, also known as shadow matter or alice matter, mirrors the properties of ordinary matter but interacts with it only via gravity or weak interaction [4]. The idea of a mirror universe first appeared in the famous parity violation paper of Lee and Yang in 1956, where they noted that while parity is violated maximally in the beta decay process in our universe, it could be a good symmetry of nature if there was another sector to our universe (called mirror world) with identical particle spectra and force content to our sector [5].\n\nKey Concepts and Research\n\nThe main topics discussed in the papers authored by T.D.

Mirror particles experience \n𝑉\n+\n𝐴\nV+A (i.e., right-handed) mirror weak interactions, while ordinary particles experience the usual \n𝑉\n−\n𝐴\nV−A (i.e., left-handed) weak interactions. This difference in interactions leads to the conservation of CP symmetry.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the work of T.D. Lee, C.N. Yang, and R.

Here are some advantages of using this technique in terms of spectral leakage:\n\n1. **Reduced Spectral Leakage**: Modulated-coupling quantum memory can effectively manage the temporal modes of quantum states, allowing for better control over the spectral properties of the stored quantum information. By using Gaussian wavelets, which have well-defined frequency characteristics, the memory can minimize spectral leakage that typically occurs when signals are not perfectly matched to the temporal modes.\n\n2. **Improved Mode Matching**: The Gaussian wavelet apodization technique allows for smoother transitions between different temporal modes. This smoothness helps in reducing the abrupt changes in the frequency spectrum, which are often responsible for spectral leakage. The modulated-coupling mechanism can enhance the fidelity of the stored states by ensuring that the temporal modes are closely aligned with the desired wavelet shapes.\n\n3. **Enhanced Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)**: By reducing spectral leakage, the overall noise in the system can be minimized. This leads to an improved signal-to-noise ratio, which is crucial for the reliable retrieval of quantum information. The Gaussian wavelet apodization helps in filtering out unwanted spectral components, thus enhancing the quality of the retrieved signal.\n\n4. **Flexibility in Temporal Mode Selection**: Modulated-coupling quantum memory allows for the selection and manipulation of various temporal modes. This flexibility enables the implementation of different apodization functions, including Gaussian wavelets, which can be tailored to specific applications. This adaptability can further help in mitigating spectral leakage by optimizing the temporal mode structure for the specific quantum state being stored.\n\n5. **Compatibility with Quantum State Manipulation**: The use of modulated-coupling techniques in quantum memory is compatible with various quantum state manipulation protocols. This compatibility allows for the integration of Gaussian wavelet apodization into broader quantum communication schemes, where controlling spectral leakage is essential for maintaining the integrity of quantum states over long distances.\n\n6. **Scalability**: Modulated-coupling quantum memory systems can be designed to be scalable, which is beneficial for practical implementations. As the system scales, maintaining low spectral leakage becomes increasingly important, and the Gaussian wavelet approach can be effectively applied across multiple channels or modes.\n\nIn summary, using modulated-coupling quantum memory for Gaussian wavelet temporal-mode apodization offers significant advantages in reducing spectral leakage, improving mode matching, enhancing signal quality, and providing flexibility and scalability in quantum information applications. These benefits are crucial for the development of efficient and reliable quantum communication systems.", "gpt4o_mini_score": 9, "marvel_standard_answer": "Oops!

It is a critical parameter that influences the dynamics of particle interactions, including the production of dark matter and the asymmetry between particles and antiparticles.\n\n2. **Transition Temperature \\( t_{m sm,tr} \\)**: This temperature typically marks a phase transition in the early universe, such as the transition from a radiation-dominated era to a matter-dominated era, or a phase transition related to the symmetry breaking of a field associated with dark matter or other particles. At this temperature, significant changes in the state of matter occur, which can affect the density fluctuations necessary for PBH formation.\n\nThe relationship between these two temperatures can be understood in terms of the evolution of the universe and the conditions required for PBH formation:\n\n- **Asymmetry and Density Fluctuations**: A small dark fermion asymmetry can lead to the generation of density fluctuations in the early universe. These fluctuations are crucial for the gravitational collapse that leads to PBH formation. The initial temperature \\( t_{m sm,0} \\) sets the scale for the energy density and the dynamics of particle interactions, while the transition temperature \\( t_{m sm,tr} \\) indicates when the conditions become favorable for these fluctuations to grow and potentially collapse into PBHs.\n\n- **Thermal History**: The relationship can also be influenced by the thermal history of the universe. As the universe expands and cools, the temperature decreases from \\( t_{m sm,0} \\) to \\( t_{m sm,tr} \\). The dynamics of particle interactions, including the production of dark fermions and the establishment of asymmetries, depend on the temperature. If the transition occurs at a temperature that is too low, it may not allow sufficient time for the necessary density fluctuations to develop.\n\nIn summary, the relationship between \\( t_{m sm,tr} \\) and \\( t_{m sm,0} \\) is crucial for understanding the conditions under which primordial black holes can form.

According to S Yamashika (2024), higher initial temperatures can lead to faster cooling, similar to the Mpemba effect [1]. This phenomenon occurs in the dark sector, where the higher the initial temperature of the system is, the faster it cools down. D Borah et al. (2023) propose a novel framework where baryon asymmetry of the Universe arises due to forbidden decay of dark matter (DM) enabled by finite-temperature effects [2]. This framework provides a deeper understanding of the relationship between the transition temperature $t_{sm,tr}$ and the initial temperature $t_{m sm,0}$. The transition temperature $t_{sm,tr}$ can be estimated using an equation that depends on the initial temperature $t_1$, which can be interpreted as $t_{m sm,0}$ [3]. The equation is given by: $t_{\\rm sm,tr} \\simeq \\left(\\frac{a_v}{2 \\ln(r_1/r_{\\rm tr})}\\right)^{1/2} =2.8 \\times10^{-6} \\textrm{ ev} \\kappa \\left(\\frac{t_1}{\\textrm{kev}}\\right)^{5/2} \\left(\\ln\\left(\\frac{r_1}{r_{\\rm tr}}\\right)\\right)^{-1/2}$. The thermal ball temperature range is $6\\textrm{ kev} \\kappa^{-2/5} \\lesssim t_{d,1} \\lesssim170\\textrm{ kev}\\kappa^{-2/5}$. The transition temperature $t_{sm}$ is around $1$ ev at CMB and $2 \\times10^{-4}$ ev at present day.

To enhance detection capabilities, LIGO works closely with the Virgo detector in Italy and the KAGRA detector in Japan as part of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration (LVK).\n\n## Upgrades and Future Detectors\n\nThe LIGO Laboratory is planning significant redesigns to improve the aLIGO technology for future gravitational wave detectors. The evolution of LIGO will continue with upgrades to the detectors, including replacing the current 40kg test mass mirrors with 100kg mirrors and much larger suspension systems. The next major step in ground-based gravitational wave instruments will involve much larger facilities, such as \"Third Generation\" or 3G gravitational wave detectors, including Cosmic Explorer with 40-km long arms, or Einstein Telescope, a triangular detector with 10km long arms buried deep underground. Additionally, a space-based gravitational wave detector, LISA (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna), is being designed and tested, which will operate three spacecraft in a triangular formation, with the distance between each satellite being 2.5 million kilometers. These upgrades aim to improve the range of the interferometers by 10 times over Initial LIGO's 15Mpc, increasing the volume of space that can be probed by 1000 times.\n\n## Parameters for Improvement\n\nSeveral specific parameters are proposed to improve the aLIGO technology for future gravitational wave detectors. These include:\n\n*   Optimization of detectors for squeezed light operation\n*   Development of state-of-the-art squeezed-light sources\n*   High-quantum-efficiency photo-electric detection\n*   Interferometer techniques supporting nonclassical quantum noise reduction\n*   Development of a QND apparatus which is quantum radiation pressure dominated\n*   Development of other signal-to-quantum-noise enhancement techniques\n\nThe parameters for A+ upgrade include:\n\n*   Frequency dependent squeezing using a 300 m filter cavity\n*   Lower loss Faraday isolators and active mode-matching control\n*   A larger diameter beamsplitter\n*   Balanced homodyne readout and associated suspended steering mirrors\n*   Test masses with mirror coatings that have a factor of 2 lower thermal noise than present coatings\n\nThe A# upgrade aims at a room temperature interferometer operating at 1 µm laser wavelength, with upgrades beyond A+, including:\n\n*   100 kg fused silica test masses\n*   Fused silica suspension fibers operating at twice the current stress level\n*   Updated suspension designs to improve controllability and reduce cross-coupling to the angular degrees of freedom\n*   Improved seismic isolation for reduced control noise\n*   Subtraction of Newtonian noise\n*   Laser power increase to 1.5 MW arm power\n*   Squeezing increase to 10 dB broadband\n\n## Technological Advancements\n\nImproving the stability of the laser source and decreasing noise that can hide weak signals coming from gravitational waves could help improve the sensitivity of gravitational wave detectors. Scientists from the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics (Albert Einstein Institute) and Leibniz Universität Hannover have made significant progress towards stable laser sources for third-generation gravitational wave detectors. They have demonstrated a laser power stability that was a factor of five better than what has been achieved by other groups using a multiphotodetector array made up of photodiodes, which convert light into electrical current, to detect any power fluctuations in the laser and then correct these noise-inducing fluctuations using a feedback loop.\n\n## Future Plans\n\nThe proposed programme aims to improve the aLIGO technology for future gravitational wave detectors by refining waveform models, carrying out deep and wide parameter space searches for coalescing binaries, GW emitted in coincidence with GRBs and supernovae, and continuous signals from rotating neutron stars. Detector sensitivity is mainly limited by thermal noise associated with the substrates of the mirrors, their reflective coatings, and their suspension elements, as well as by noise resulting from the quantum nature of the light used in sensing.\n\nThe LIGO Voyager is being planned to improve the sensitivity by an additional factor of two and halve the low-frequency cutoff to 10 Hz. Plans call for the glass mirrors and 1064 nm lasers to be replaced by even larger 160 kg silicon test masses, cooled to 123 K.\n\nThe international cooperation between LIGO, Virgo, Virgo, and KAGRA has achieved a significant milestone in gravitational wave detection. Detection of 200th candidate gravitational wave signal during O4 observation run.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe future upgrades to the ground-based gravitational wave detectors, such as aLIGO, are proposed to be improved through majorly two upgrades. The rationale behind these upgrades to improve the existing aLIGO technology for better detection is likely to enhance the sensitivity.\n\n<https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/page/ligo-evol>\n<https://news.ucr.edu/articles/2025/02/14/new-technology-enhances-gravitational-wave-detection>\n<https://www.numberanalytics.com/blog/aligo-future-gravitational-wave-astronomy>\n<https://dcc.ligo.org/LIGO-T2400407/public>\n<https://dcc.ligo.org/LIGO-P1300081/public>\n<https://arxiv.org/html/2508.08423v1>\n<https://www.electronicspecifier.com/industries/aerospace-defence/increasing-the-sensitivity-of-gravitational-wave-detectors/>\n<https://www.optica.org/about/newsroom/news_releases/2024/december/seeing_deeper_into_the_cosmos_with_gravitational-wave_detectors/>\n<https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.102.022008>\n<https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4311950/>\n<https://arxiv.org/html/2506.08315v1>\n<https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/page/science-impact>\n<https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4434/13/2/28/pdf>\n<https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=ST%2FN005406%2F2&pn=8&fetchSize=25&selectedSortableField=title&selectedSortOrder=ASC>\n<https://thesis.library.caltech.edu/17398/1/brian_seymour_2025.pdf>\n<https://www.researchgate.net/publication/393656338_Improving_gravitational_wave_search_sensitivity_with_TIER_Trigger_Inference_using_Extended_strain_Representation>\n<https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=ST/Y004167/1>\n<https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/gravitational-waves-ligo-virgo-kagra-detect-200th-signal/56647/>\n<https://www.aei.mpg.de/33180/interferometry-on-earth>\n<https://www.scirp.org/journal/paper?paperid=43477>\n<https://nsf-gov-resources.nsf.gov/files/voyager-white-paper-submission.pdf?VersionId=4NArHDZMIDaTccXiopz8ZLVk2o2Hc_dy>\n<https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6382/ab01c5/ampdf>\n<https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230905928_Advanced_LIGO_The_next_generation_of_gravitational_wave_detectors>\n<https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/physics/research/groups/igr/research/detectors/>\n<https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.111.062002>\n<https://cerncourier.com/a/catching-a-gravitational-wave/>\n<https://inspirehep.net/literature/2896977>\n<https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6382/ac5b31>\n<https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017nsf....1707835T/abstract>\n<https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/news/ligo20250320>\n</ARTICLE>\n</QUERY>",

This time is crucial because it marks the transition from a phase where the axion field is in a potential well to a phase where it behaves like a classical field, which can then contribute to various physical phenomena, including gravitational waves.\n\nThe parameters \\( f_a \\) (the axion decay constant) are significant because they determine the mass of the axion and its coupling to other particles. Specifically, the larger the value of \\( f_a \\), the lighter the axion mass, and the later the time \\( t_* \\) will occur in the cosmic timeline. This is because a higher \\( f_a \\) corresponds to a lower energy scale for axion production, which affects the dynamics of the early universe and the subsequent evolution of the axion field.\n\nIn terms of gravitational waves, future experimental efforts aim to detect signals that could be produced by axion-like particles. The expected sensitivity of these experiments is often related to the values of \\( f_a \\). For instance, if \\( f_a \\) is on the order of \\( 10^8 \\) GeV, the gravitational wave signals might be detectable in certain frequency ranges, while higher values like \\( 10^9 \\) or \\( 10^{10} \\) GeV could push the signals into different ranges or make them harder to detect.\n\nIn summary, \\( t_* \\) represents the time of coherent oscillation of the axion field, which is influenced by the axion decay constant \\( f_a \\). The relationship between \\( f_a \\) and the expected future experimental gravitational wave reaches is crucial for understanding the detectability of axion-related phenomena, as different values of \\( f_a \\) will lead to different gravitational wave signatures and frequencies that experiments will target.", "gpt4o_mini_score": 9, "marvel_standard_answer": "Oops!

The maximum periapsis distance occurs when the relative velocity is at its maximum, which can be related to the escape velocity and the gravitational potential.\n\nThe gravitational force between two masses \\( m_1 \\) and \\( m_2 \\) is given by:\n\n\\[\nF = \\frac{G m_1 m_2}{r^2}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( G \\) is the gravitational constant.

The specific orbital energy \\( \\epsilon \\) is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\epsilon = \\frac{v^2}{2} - \\frac{G m_1}{r}\n\\]\n\nAt the maximum periapsis distance, the specific energy will be zero (the body is just at the threshold of escaping the gravitational influence). Thus, we set \\( \\epsilon = 0 \\):\n\n\\[\n0 = \\frac{v_{m rel}^2}{2} - \\frac{G m_1}{r_{mp, max}}\n\\]\n\nRearranging this gives:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{G m_1}{r_{mp, max}} = \\frac{v_{m rel}^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( r_{mp, max} \\):\n\n\\[\nr_{mp, max} = \\frac{2G m_1}{v_{m rel}^2}\n\\]\n\nNow, if we want to express this in terms of \\( g \\), where \\( g \\) is the acceleration due to gravity at a distance \\( r \\) from mass \\( m_1 \\):\n\n\\[\ng = \\frac{G m_1}{r^2}\n\\]\n\nWe can express \\( G m_1 \\) in terms of \\( g \\) and \\( r \\):\n\n\\[\nG m_1 = g r^2\n\\]\n\nSubstituting this into our expression for \\( r_{mp, max} \\):\n\n\\[\nr_{mp, max} = \\frac{2(g r^2)}{v_{m rel}^2}\n\\]\n\nHowever, to express \\( r_{mp, max} \\) solely in terms of \\( g \\), \\( m_1 \\), \\( m_2 \\), \\( c \\), and \\( v_{m rel} \\), we can simplify further by recognizing that \\( g \\) is a function of \\( m_1 \\) and the distance \\( r \\). \n\nThus, the final expression for the maximum periapsis distance \\( r_{mp, max} \\) can be summarized as:\n\n\\[\nr_{mp, max} = \\frac{2 G m_1}{v_{m rel}^2}\n\\]\n\nThis is the relationship that connects the maximum periapsis distance with the gravitational constant, the mass of the primary body, and the relative velocity.

Understanding this relationship requires delving into the specifics of general relativity, the two-body problem, and related research.\n\nIn general relativity, the two-body problem involves high-energy phenomena and speeds approaching the speed of light \n𝑐\nc. The differences between general relativity and other theories become significant when dealing with speeds approaching \n𝑐\nc and with high-energy phenomena. For a comprehensive understanding, one can refer to General Relativity on Wikipedia.\n\nSeveral research papers and publications discuss the relationship between \n𝑟\n𝑚\n𝑝\n,\n𝑚\n𝑎\n𝑥\nr\nmp,max\n\t​\n\n and \n𝑐\nc in the context of general relativity and the two-body problem. One such paper presents an exact analytical solution to the two-body problem in general relativity using a previously proposed reformulation, available at Reformulation of Mass-Energy Equivalence Solving the Two-Body Problem in General Relativity.\n\nThe two-body problem in post-Newtonian approximations of general relativity provides recent results concerning the equations of motion and the associated Lagrangian formulation of compact binary systems, at the third post-Newtonian order (\n1\n/\n𝑐\n6\n1/c\n6\n beyond the Newtonian acceleration). These equations are crucial for constructing theoretical templates for searching and analyzing gravitational-wave signals from inspiralling compact binaries in VIRGO-type experiments. More details can be found in Equations of Motion and Lagrangian Formulation.\n\nHowever, a specific formula for the maximum periapsis distance \n𝑟\n𝑚\n𝑝\n,\n𝑚\n𝑎\n𝑥\nr\nmp,max\n\t​\n\n in terms of \n𝑔\ng, \n𝑚\n1\nm\n1\n\t​\n\n, \n𝑚\n2\nm\n2\n\t​\n\n, \n𝑐\nc, and \n𝑣\n𝑚\n𝑟\n𝑒\n𝑙\nv\nmrel\n\t​\n\n is not directly stated in the provided sources. Further information from specific sources, such as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-body_problem and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-body_problem_in_general_relativity, would be necessary to derive a more detailed equation.\n\nThe relationship between the maximum periapsis distance (\n𝑟\n𝑚\n𝑝\n,\n𝑚\n𝑎\n𝑥\nr\nmp,max\n\t​\n\n) and the relative velocity at infinity (\n𝑣\n𝑚\n𝑟\n𝑒\n𝑙\nv\nmrel\n\t​\n\n) in a two-body problem is given by \n𝑟\n𝑚\n𝑝\n,\n𝑚\n𝑎\n𝑥\n=\n𝜇\n𝑣\n𝑟\n𝑒\n𝑙\n2\nr\nmp,max\n\t​\n\n=\nv\nrel\n2\n\t​\n\nμ\n\t​\n\n, where \n𝜇\n=\n𝐺\n(\n𝑀\n1\n+\n𝑀\n2\n)\nμ=G(M\n1\n\t​\n\n+M\n2\n\t​\n\n) is the gravitational parameter, \n𝐺\nG is the gravitational constant, and \n𝑀\n1\nM\n1\n\t​\n\n and \n𝑀\n2\nM\n2\n\t​\n\n are the masses of the two bodies.\n\nA direct formula for the maximum periapsis distance \n𝑟\n𝑚\n𝑝\n,\n𝑚\n𝑎\n𝑥\nr\nmp,max\n\t​\n\n in terms of \n𝑔\ng, \n𝑚\n1\nm\n1\n\t​\n\n, \n𝑚\n2\nm\n2\n\t​\n\n, \n𝑐\nc, and \n𝑣\n𝑚\n𝑟\n𝑒\n𝑙\nv\nmrel\n\t​\n\n could not be found in the provided texts. However, the periapsis distance \n𝑟\n𝑚\n𝑝\nr\nmp\n\t​\n\n can be expressed as \n𝑟\n𝑚\n𝑝\n=\n𝑎\n(\n1\n−\n𝑒\n)\nr\nmp\n\t​\n\n=a(1−e) and \n𝑟\n𝑚\n𝑝\n=\n𝑝\n1\n+\n𝑒\nr\nmp\n\t​\n\n=\n1+e\np\n\t​\n\n, with \n𝑒\n=\n1\n+\n2\n𝐸\n𝐿\n2\n𝑚\n1\n𝑚\n2\n𝐺\ne=\n1+\nm\n1\n\t​\n\nm\n2\n\t​\n\nG\n2EL\n2\n\t​\n\n\t​\n\n.

This coefficient is particularly relevant in the study of gravitational waves emitted during such events.\n\n### Static Tidal Effects\n\nThe static tidal effects refer to the influence of the neutron star's mass and structure on the gravitational field of the black hole. When a neutron star approaches a black hole, the black hole's gravitational field can deform the neutron star, leading to tidal forces that can affect the neutron star's shape and internal structure. The matching coefficient encapsulates how these tidal effects manifest in the gravitational wave signal.\n\n### Relation to Gravitational Wave Observations\n\n1. **Gravitational Wave Signal**: During the coalescence of a BH-NS system, gravitational waves are emitted, carrying information about the dynamics of the system, including the tidal interactions. The matching coefficient helps in modeling the gravitational waveforms produced during the inspiral and merger phases.\n\n2. **Tidal Deformability**: The matching coefficient is often related to the tidal deformability of the neutron star, which is a measure of how much the neutron star deforms in response to the tidal field of the black hole. This deformability affects the frequency and amplitude of the gravitational waves emitted.\n\n3. **Parameter Estimation**: In gravitational wave astronomy, the matching coefficient can be used in parameter estimation algorithms to infer properties of the neutron star, such as its equation of state (EOS). The EOS determines how matter behaves at extremely high densities, which is crucial for understanding neutron star structure and stability.\n\n4. **Modeling and Interpretation**: Accurate modeling of the matching coefficient allows for better interpretation of gravitational wave signals detected by observatories like LIGO and Virgo. By comparing observed waveforms with theoretical models that include tidal effects, researchers can extract information about the masses, spins, and tidal properties of the neutron star.\n\nIn summary, the matching coefficient in BH-NS coalescence is a critical parameter that quantifies static tidal effects and plays a significant role in the analysis and interpretation of gravitational wave observations, providing insights into the nature of neutron stars and the fundamental physics of strong gravitational fields.", "gpt4o_mini_score": 9, "marvel_standard_answer": "<QUERY> What does the matching coefficient in the context of black hole-neutron star (bh-ns) coalescence indicate about the static tidal effects and how is it related to gravitational wave observations? </QUERY>\n\n## Step 1: Understand the Matching Coefficient\nThe matching coefficient, denoted by $C_\\Omega$, is a value that indicates the similarity between different gravitational waveforms in the context of black hole-neutron star (BH-NS) coalescence.

The tidal deformability $\\Lambda$, which characterizes the static tidal effects, is related to the quadrupolar tidal Love number $k_2$ and the radius $R$ of the neutron star. The measurement of tidal deformability can help identify matter effects in the waveform, which is crucial for gravitational wave observations. </ANSWER>\n\n# The Matching Coefficient in Black Hole-Neutron Star Coalescence: Understanding Static Tidal Effects and Gravitational Wave Observations\n====================================================================================\n\nThe matching coefficient in the context of black hole-neutron star (BH-NS) coalescence is a crucial parameter that indicates the similarity between different gravitational waveforms. It is related to the static tidal effects through the tidal deformability of the neutron star. The tidal deformability, represented by $\\Lambda$, is a key parameter that characterizes the static tidal effects.\n\n## Definition and Significance of the Matching Coefficient\n\nThe matching coefficient, denoted by the constant $C_\\Omega$, has a value of $\\lesssim0.3$ for a system composed of a neutron star (NS) with an irrotational velocity field and a non-spinning black hole (BH) [1]. This small value indicates that mass shedding is enhanced by significant tidal deformation and/or possibly by general relativistic gravity of the NS.\n\n## Relationship with Tidal Deformability and Gravitational Wave Observations\n\nThe tidal deformability of a neutron star, denoted by $\\Lambda$, is related to the quadrupolar tidal Love number $k_2$ and the radius $R$ of the neutron star by $\\Lambda = \\frac{2}{3}k_2(\\frac{R}{M})^5$, where $M$ is the mass of the neutron star [5]. The matching coefficient is related to the static tidal effects and can be inferred from the gravitational wave observations through the change in the gravitational wave due to finite-size effects at large separation [6].\n\n## Impact on Gravitational Wave Observations\n\nThe presence of matter in BH-NS mergers presents a unique opportunity for a broader spectrum of observations, shedding light on the properties of matter under extreme densities [8]. The matching coefficient plays a role in gravitational wave observations, and its impact can be observed in the change in the number of orbital cycles of coalescence, denoted as $\\Delta N_{orb}$ [11]. Specifically, the f-mode resonances induce a large change in $\\Delta N_{orb}$, with the maximum $\\Delta N$.\n\n## Phenomenological Models for Gravitational Wave Signature\n\nPhenomenological models have been developed to describe BH-NS mergers, such as the phenomnsbh model, which describes the gravitational waves (GWs) produced by NSBH systems [13]. This model covers mass ratios from equal-mass up to 15.\n\n## Tidal Effects and Neutron Star Properties\n\nTidal effects arise from the response of the neutron star (NS) to the external gravitational field of the companion [10]. The tidal deformability $\\lambda_\\ell$ for each $\\ell$th multipole is defined as $Q_\\ell =-\\lambda_\\ell \\, {{{\\mathcal {E}}}}_\\ell$. The associated effect on gravitational waves (GWs) steeply increases with smaller separation or higher GW frequency.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the matching coefficient in the context of black hole-neutron star (BH-NS) coalescence indicates the static tidal effects and is related to gravitational wave observations. The tidal deformability of the neutron star plays a crucial role in characterizing the static tidal effects. The study of BH-NS mergers provides a unique opportunity to explore high-density nuclear matter and constrain the equation of state (EOS) of high-density nuclear matter.\n\n## References\n\n[1]

The tidal deformability of the neutron star plays a crucial role in characterizing the static tidal effects. The study of BH-NS mergers provides a unique opportunity to explore high-density nuclear matter and constrain the equation of state (EOS) of high-density nuclear matter.\n\nThe matching coefficient \n𝐶\nΩ\nC\nΩ\n\t​\n\n and the tidal deformability \nΛ\nΛ are highly correlated, particularly for more massive neutron stars.

This relationship, along with their collective impact, is crucial for the detection of gravitational waves in black hole-neutron star coalescence.\n\nThe matching coefficient \n𝐶\nΩ\nC\nΩ\n\t​\n\n influences the measurement of neutron star radius and equation of state through gravitational wave observations of black hole-neutron star coalescence, specifically in relation to tidal deformability. For a neutron star with mass in solar masses, \n𝐶\nΩ\nC\nΩ\n\t​\n\n and the tidal deformability are highly correlated. However, for more massive neutron stars, the tidal deformability shows a different relationship.\n\nThe tidal deformability allows us to distinguish between different waveforms. For a given signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), BNS templates have \n4\n4 parameters: chirp mass \n𝑀\nM, mass ratio \n𝑞\nq, and tidal deformabilities \nΛ\n1\nΛ\n1\n\t​\n\n, \nΛ\n2\nΛ\n2\n\t​\n\n. Measuring tidal deformability can help identify matter effects in the waveform, which is relevant to gravitational wave observations.\n\nThe presence of matter in BH-NS mergers presents a unique opportunity for a broader spectrum of observations, shedding light on the properties of matter under extreme densities.

The dynamics of such systems can be complex, especially when considering the gravitational interactions and the potential for mass transfer.\n\n2. **Bound vs. Unbound Systems**: For a binary system to remain bound, the total energy of the system must be negative. This is determined by the gravitational potential energy and the kinetic energy of the stars in the binary. If the black hole approaches the companion star too closely (especially at periastron), it can lead to scenarios where the system may become unbound, particularly if the black hole's velocity is high enough to escape the gravitational pull of the companion.\n\n3. **Periastron Passage**: The periastron is the point of closest approach in the orbit of the binary system. If the black hole passes too close to the companion star at periastron, it can lead to tidal interactions or even the possibility of the black hole being captured by the companion star, depending on the relative velocities and the specific orbital parameters.\n\n4. **Kicking into a Wide Orbit**: The chances of the binary system being kicked into a wider orbit depend on several factors, including the initial conditions of the orbit, the mass ratio, and the specific interactions during periastron passage. If the black hole experiences a significant gravitational interaction with the companion star, it could gain enough energy to be ejected into a wider orbit or even escape the system entirely.\n\n### Summary of Probabilities\n\n- **Probability of Remaining Bound**: This depends on the specific orbital parameters (eccentricity, semi-major axis, etc.) and the mass ratio. Generally, if the black hole does not pass within a critical distance of the companion star (which can be estimated based on the Roche limit and the specific energy of the system), the probability of remaining bound is higher.\n\n- **Probability of Kicking into a Wide Orbit**: This is more complex and would require detailed simulations or analytical models to estimate. Factors such as the initial velocity of the black hole, the mass of the companion star, and the eccentricity of the orbit play significant roles. In some cases, if the black hole gains enough energy during the interaction, it could be kicked into a wider orbit.\n\nIn conclusion, while it is difficult to provide exact probabilities without specific parameters and simulations, the dynamics of mass ratio inversions in binary systems suggest that careful consideration of the orbital mechanics and interactions is crucial in determining the outcomes of such systems.", "gpt4o_mini_score": 6, "marvel_standard_answer": "<QUERY> 'What is the probability that a binary system with a mass ratio inversion remains bound without the black hole falling inside the companion periastron, and what are the chances of it being kicked into a wide orbit?' </QUERY>\n\n## Step 1: Understand the Query\nThe query asks for the probability of a binary system with a mass ratio inversion remaining bound without the black hole falling inside the companion periastron and the chances of it being kicked into a wide orbit.\n\n## Step 2: Read and Analyze Document1\nDocument1 provides specific probabilities: a $\\sim38\\%$ chance of the binary system remaining bound without the black hole falling inside the companion periastron, and a $\\sim1\\%$ chance of being kicked into a wide orbit ($\\gtrsim5$ AU; $e \\gtrsim0.8$).

In this article, we will summarize the findings of these studies and provide an overview of the current understanding of this phenomenon.\n\n## Probability of Remaining Bound\n\nThe probability that a binary system with a mass ratio inversion remains bound without the black hole falling inside the companion periastron is approximately 38% [1]. This probability is based on a model with a 2.7 M⊙ black hole receiving a ∼400 km s−1 kick, and a progenitor star with Mfinal = 23.5 M⊙ and metallicity z = 0.01. The core-collapse supernova (CCSN) that forms the low-mass gap (LMG) object occurs at a separation of ∼0.23 AU.\n\n## Chances of Being Kicked into a Wide Orbit\n\nThe chances of the binary system being kicked into a wide orbit (≳5 AU; e ≳ 0.8) are approximately 1% [1]. This probability is also based on the same model mentioned above.\n\n## Effect of Kick Velocity\n\nAssuming a kick velocity of w = 1200 km s−1 and random kick orientation, there is a 34% probability of surviving and merging within a Hubble time [1].\n\n## Study of Mass Ratio Reversed Binary Black Hole Mergers\n\nA study of mass ratio reversed binary black hole mergers was conducted using a large set of 560 population synthesis models [2]. This study provides further insights into the phenomenon of mass ratio inversion in binary black hole mergers.\n\n## Binary-Single Interactions\n\nThe probability of a GW capture during resonant interactions is most efficient if q2 ≃ q3 [3]. The mass-ratio distribution of BBH coalescence due to inspirals is ∝ m1−1q2.9+α, where α is the exponent of the BH mass function.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the probability that a binary system with a mass ratio inversion remains bound without the black hole falling inside the companion periastron is approximately 38%, and the chances of it being kicked into a wide orbit are approximately 1%.

Conditions for the binary to remain bound include \n𝑉\nf\n≥\n𝑉\ne\nV\nf\n\t​\n\n≥V\ne\n\t​\n\n or \n𝜒\n≥\n2\nχ≥2, with \n𝜒\nχ depending on the masses.\n\nStudy of Mass Ratio Reversed Binary Black Hole Mergers\n\nA study of mass ratio reversed binary black hole mergers was conducted using a large set of 560 population synthesis models [2]. This study provides further insights into the phenomenon of mass ratio inversion in binary black hole mergers.\n\nBinary-Single Interactions\n\nThe probability of a GW capture during resonant interactions is most efficient if q2 ≃ q3 [3]. The mass-ratio distribution of BBH coalescence due to inspirals is ∝ m1−1q2.9+α, where α is the exponent of the BH mass function.\n\nEffects of Metallicity\n\nThe effects of different metallicities on the probability of a binary system with a mass ratio inversion remaining bound without the black hole falling inside the companion periastron are significant. Metal-poor systems are more stable compared to their metal-rich counterparts [4]. Low metallicity systems have a lower instability mass ratio than those with higher metal content, making them more stable.\n\nMathematical Framework\n\nThe effects of varying the kick velocity on the probability of a binary system with a mass ratio inversion remaining bound without the black hole falling inside the companion periastron can be understood by analyzing the relationship between the kick velocity, the orbital velocity, and the binary separation [5]. The kick velocity \n𝑣\n𝑘\nv\nk\n\t​\n\n changes the velocity of the exploding star from \n𝑣\n0\nv\n0\n\t​\n\n to \n𝑣\n0\n+\n𝑣\n𝑘\nv\n0\n\t​\n\n+v\nk\n\t​\n\n. Applying energy and angular momentum conservation to the binary system before and after the core collapse, the final values of semimajor axis \n𝑎\n𝑓\na\nf\n\t​\n\n and eccentricity \n𝑒\ne can be determined.\n\nEffects of Varying Separation at Core-Collapse Supernova\n\nThe effects of varying the separation at the core-collapse supernova on the probability of a binary system with a mass ratio inversion remaining bound without the black hole falling inside the companion periastron can be analyzed using specific equations [6]. The probability of disruption \nΠ\n𝑑\nΠ\nd\n\t​\n\n is given by \nΠ\n𝑑\n=\n𝐸\n𝑑\n−\n𝑒\nsin\n⁡\n𝐸\n𝑑\n𝜋\nΠ\nd\n\t​\n\n=\nπ\nE\nd\n\t​\n\n−esinE\nd\n\t​\n\n\t​\n\n, where \n𝐸\n𝑑\nE\nd\n\t​\n\n is the eccentric anomaly corresponding to \n𝑟\n𝑑\nr\nd\n\t​\n\n, and \n𝑟\n𝑑\n/\n𝑎\nr\nd\n\t​\n\n/a is given by an equation (10.8). The survival probability \nΠ\n𝑠\n≡\n1\n−\nΠ\n𝑑\nΠ\ns\n\t​\n\n≡1−Π\nd\n\t​\n\n is illustrated in Fig. 10.1 for a binary with an initial semi-major axis of \n100\n𝑅\n⊙\n100R\n⊙\n\t​\n\n, in which a \n10\n𝑀\n⊙\n10M\n⊙\n\t​\n\n star explodes to leave a \n1.34\n𝑀\n⊙\n1.34M\n⊙\n\t​\n\n neutron star.\n\nAdditional Insights\n\nFurther analysis of the problem has been conducted, and additional insights have been gained. The probability of a binary system with a mass ratio inversion remaining bound without the black hole falling inside the companion periastron has been studied in various contexts, including the effects of kick velocity, metallicity, and binary-single interactions.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the probability that a binary system with a mass ratio inversion remains bound without the black hole falling inside the companion periastron is approximately 38%, and the chances of it being kicked into a wide orbit are approximately 1%. These probabilities are based on specific models and assumptions, and further studies are needed to confirm these findings.\n\nReferences\n[1] https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/pdf/2022/01/aa42322-21.pdf\n[2] https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ac8879\n[3] https://arxiv.org/html/2405.16999v1\n[4] https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/520/4/5724/7031771\n[5] https://arxiv.org/html/2412.03461v1\n[6] https://www.astro.ru.nl/~onnop/education/binaries_utrecht_notes/Binaries_ch9-10.pdf\nhttps://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024MNRAS.535.2494W/abstract\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/374698300_Effects_of_Metallicity_on_the_Instability_Mass_Ratio_of_Low_Mass_Contact_Binary_Systems\nhttps://www.astro.physik.uni-potsdam.de/~dpauli/master_pauli_daniel.pdf\nhttps://arxiv.org/html/2504.17903v1 </FINAL_DETAILED_REPORT>", "marvel_deepsearch_score": 9, "evaluation_model_type": "openai", "evaluation_model_name": "gpt-4o-mini", "qa_model_type": "openai", "qa_model_name": "gpt-4o-mini", "gpt4o_mini_answer_relevancy": 0.85, "gpt4o_mini_answer_correctness": 0.3, "gpt4o_mini_faithfulness": 0.05, "marvel_standard_answer_relevancy": 1.0, "marvel_standard_answer_correctness": 0.98, "marvel_standard_faithfulness": 0.98, "marvel_deepsearch_answer_relevancy": 0.92, "marvel_deepsearch_answer_correctness": 0.98, "marvel_deepsearch_faithfulness": 0.87}

Here’s a step-by-step outline of how to approach this problem:\n\n### 1. Define the Parameters\n- **Observer Distance (D)**: The distance from the observer to the source of the emission.\n- **Half Opening Angle (θ)**: The angle that defines the cone of emission from the source.\n- **Density (ρ)**: The density of the medium through which the light travels, which can affect the light curve due to scattering or absorption.\n- **Energy (E)**: The energy of the emitted photons, which can influence the observed flux.\n- **Frequency (ν)**: The frequency of the emitted radiation, which is related to the energy by \\(E = hν\\) (where \\(h\\) is Planck's constant).\n\n### 2. Determine the Emission Geometry\n- For an **on-axis observer**, the observer is located along the axis of the emission cone. The light curve will be dominated by the direct emission from the source.\n- For an **off-axis observer**, the observer is located outside the axis of the emission cone. The light curve will be affected by the angle of emission and the geometry of the source.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Flux\nThe flux \\(F\\) received by the observer can be calculated using the following formula:\n\n\\[\nF = \\frac{L}{4\\pi D^2}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(L\\) is the luminosity of the source. The luminosity can depend on the energy and the density of the medium.\n\n### 4. Consider the Emission Profile\nThe emission profile can be modeled based on the half opening angle and the density. For example, if the emission is isotropic within the cone defined by the half opening angle, you can integrate the contributions from different angles.\n\n### 5. Doppler Effects\nFor relativistic sources, consider the Doppler effect, which can shift the frequency of the observed light depending on the relative motion of the source and the observer. This is particularly important for off-axis observers.\n\n### 6. Time Dilation\nIf the source is moving relativistically, you may need to account for time dilation effects, which can affect the observed light curve.\n\n### 7. Light Curve Calculation\n- For an **on-axis observer**, the light curve can be computed directly from the luminosity and the distance.\n- For an **off-axis observer**, you may need to integrate the contributions from different parts of the emission region, taking into account the angle and the distance to each part of the emission.\n\n### 8. Numerical Simulation\nIn many cases, especially for complex geometries or relativistic effects, numerical simulations may be necessary to accurately compute the light curve. This can involve ray tracing techniques or Monte Carlo simulations to model the propagation of light through the medium.\n\n### 9. Plotting the Light Curve\nOnce you have computed the flux as a function of time for both on-axis and off-axis observers, you can plot the light curves. The x-axis will typically represent time, while the y-axis will represent the flux or luminosity received by the observer.\n\n### Conclusion\nBy following these steps and considering the relevant physical effects, you can obtain the light curves for both on-axis and off-axis observers given the specified parameters. The complexity of the calculations will depend on the specifics of the emission mechanism and the geometry of the source.", "gpt4o_mini_score": 9, "marvel_standard_answer": "<QUERY> How can the light curve for an on-axis and off-axis observer be obtained given the parameters of observer distance, half opening angle, density, energy, and frequency? </QUERY>\n\nTo obtain the light curve for an on-axis and off-axis observer given the parameters of observer distance, half opening angle, density, energy, and frequency, various approaches and formulas can be applied as discussed in the provided documents.\n\n## Step 1: Understanding the Parameters\nThe parameters involved include observer distance, half opening angle, density, energy, and frequency. These parameters play crucial roles in determining the light curves for both on-axis and off-axis observers.\n\n## Step 2: Light Curve Equations\nFor on-axis events, the light curve can be described by the equation $F_{on}(t) = \\sqrt{\\nu} \\left( \\left( \\frac{t}{t_{jb}} \\right)^{-\\nu \\alpha/2} F_{jb} + \\left( \\frac{t}{t_{jb}} \\right)^{\\nu \\beta/2} \\right)^{-1/\\nu}$, where $t_{jb}$ and $F_{jb}$ are the time and spectral flux density at jet break, $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are the asymptotic power law exponents, and $\\nu$ is a smoothening parameter.\n\n## Step 3: Off-Axis Light Curve\nFor off-axis events, the light curve is given by $F_{off}(t) = \\left( \\left( \\frac{t}{t_{max}} \\right)^{-\\nu \\alpha/(\\alpha + \\beta)} F_{max} + \\left( \\frac{t}{t_{max}} \\right)^{\\nu \\beta/(\\alpha + \\beta)} \\right)^{-(\\alpha + \\beta)/\\nu}$. The parameters $t_{jb}$, $F_{jb}$, $t_{max}$, $F_{max}$, $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, and $\\nu$ can be connected to the input parameters of the forward shock model.\n\n## Step 4: Connections to Input Parameters\nThe connections are given by linear regression and machine learning analyses, considering parameter ranges such as $2 \\times 10^{49} \\, \\text{erg} \\leq E_{K,iso} \\leq 9 \\times 10^{52} \\, \\text{erg}$, $10^{-4} \\, \\text{cm}^{-3} \\leq n_0 \\leq 10^{-2} \\, \\text{cm}^{-3}$, $0 \\leq \\theta_{obs} \\leq 0.18$ (on-axis), and $0.25 \\leq \\theta_{obs} \\leq 0.8$ (off-axis).\n\n## Step 5: Simulation and Modeling Approaches\nSeveral documents discuss detailed simulations and modeling approaches, including the use of relativistic hydrodynamics simulations with synchrotron radiation models, two-dimensional relativistic hydrodynamics simulations, and structured jet scenarios.\n\n## Step 6: Conclusion\nGiven the complexity and the variety of approaches discussed, the light curve for an on-axis and off-axis observer can be obtained through detailed astrophysical modeling, simulation, and analytical equations that relate the observer distance, half opening angle, density, energy, and frequency.\n\n<ANSWER>\nThe light curve for an on-axis and off-axis observer can be obtained given the parameters of observer distance, half opening angle, density, energy, and frequency through various astrophysical models and simulations.

Specific models and formulas can be found in the referenced documents, such as those from arXiv and other scientific publications.\n</ANSWER>\n\n# Light Curves for On-Axis and Off-Axis Observers of Gamma-Ray Burst Afterglows\n## Introduction\n\nThe light curves for on-axis and off-axis observers of gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows can be obtained given certain parameters, including observer distance, half opening angle, density, energy, and frequency. Various studies have explored how these parameters affect the light curves, providing insights into the physics of GRB afterglows.\n\n## Parameterization of Light Curves\n\nThe light curve for an on-axis observer can be parameterized using a broken power law in terms of physical parameters. For on-axis events, the light curve is given by $F_{on}(t) = \\sqrt{\\nu} \\left( \\left( \\frac{t}{t_{jb}} \\right)^{-\\nu \\alpha/2} F_{jb} + \\left( \\frac{t}{t_{jb}} \\right)^{\\nu \\beta/2} \\right)^{-1/\\nu}$, where $t_{jb}$ and $F_{jb}$ are the time and spectral flux density at jet break, $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are the asymptotic power law exponents, and $\\nu$ is a smoothening parameter [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.01158](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.01158).\n\n## Off-Axis Light Curves\n\nFor off-axis events, the light curve is given by $F_{off}(t) = \\left( \\left( \\frac{t}{t_{max}} \\right)^{-\\nu \\alpha/(\\alpha + \\beta)} F_{max} + \\left( \\frac{t}{t_{max}} \\right)^{\\nu \\beta/(\\alpha + \\beta)} \\right)^{-(\\alpha + \\beta)/\\nu}$. The parameters $t_{jb}$, $F_{jb}$, $t_{max}$, $F_{max}$, $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, and $\\nu$ can be connected to the input parameters of the forward shock model, including the equivalent isotropic kinetic energy $E_{K,iso}$, the observing angle $\\theta_{obs}$, and the circumburst density $n_0$ [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.01158](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.01158).\n\n## Simulation-Based Models\n\nSimulations using relativistic hydrodynamics and synchrotron radiation models have also been used to compute light curves for on-axis and off-axis observers. These simulations cover the full transition from relativistic to non-relativistic flow and use parameters such as isotropic energy $E_{iso}$, jet half opening angle $\\theta_0$, circumburst proton number density $n$, and observer luminosity distance $d_L$ [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1006.5125](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1006.5125).\n\n## Effects of Observer Angle\n\nThe observer angle $\\theta_{obs}$ has a significant impact on the light curve. For observers at $\\theta_{obs} < \\theta_0$, where $\\theta_0$ is the initial jet opening angle, the light curve is similar to that for an on-axis observer. For observers at $\\theta_{obs} > \\theta_0$, the light curve rises at early times, peaking when the jet Lorentz factor $\\Gamma$ is $\\sim 1/\\theta_{obs}$, and approaches that seen by an on-axis observer at later times [http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002ApJ...570L..61G/abstract](http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002ApJ...570L..61G/abstract).\n\n## Polarization and Light Curves\n\nThe polarization degree and flux are also important factors in understanding GRB afterglows. The peak polarization level occurs at a time close to that of a break in the light curve, and an analytical approximation for the peak polarization level has been provided, which depends on the geometrical parameters of the system [https://arxiv.org/html/2507.17826](https://arxiv.org/html/2507.17826).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the light curves for on-axis and off-axis observers of GRB afterglows can be obtained given parameters such as observer distance, half opening angle, density, energy, and frequency. Various studies have explored the effects of these parameters on the light curves, providing insights into the physics of GRB afterglows.

Triangulation methods have been widely used for this purpose, but their accuracy and agreement with other methods have been topics of research.\n\n## Triangulation Methods\nTriangulation methods use the differences in arrival times and phases of gravitational waves at different detectors to estimate the sky location of the source. The timing triangulation (TT) method, a two-dimensional application of the Fisher information Matrix (FIM) technique, considers time and phase, and its calculation of timing uncertainty is given by Eq. (5) [1]. However, the TT method effectively considers three free angles: two sky angles and phase, and yields larger median sky localization areas compared to fully coherent Bayesian parameter estimation methods.\n\n## Limitations of Triangulation Methods\nThe triangulation approach underestimates how well a source can be localized, as it does not include all the relevant information [2]. Its predictions can be improved by introducing the requirement of phase consistency between detectors. Triangulation always performs poorly for a two-detector network, but, with the inclusion of phase coherence, can provide an estimate for the average performance of a three-detector network.\n\n## Comparison with Bayesian Methods\nBayesian methods have been used to compare networks of second-generation ground-based detectors [3]. The sky localization area was calculated by passing posterior probability samples of distance, right ascension, and declination to the `ligo.skymap` function. The results show that the most sophisticated techniques, which perform a coherent Bayesian analysis, provide the most accurate results and smallest confidence regions.\n\n## Time-and-Phase Triangulation\nThe inclusion of phase consistency information in timing-triangulation techniques can bring average predictions to better agreement [4]. A study used both BAYESTAR and LALINFERENCE to analyze the potential, resulting in a median area of the 90% credible region of 632 deg^2 and a median searched area of 132 deg^2 [5].\n\n## Applications and Results\nThe analysis of gravitational wave events, specifically GW150914, involved estimating credible regions using various methods [6]. Four pipelines, namely CWB, LIB, BAYESTAR, and LALInference, produced sky localization information. The results show that the 90% credible level contours for each algorithm in equatorial coordinates, with the orthographic projection centered on the centroid of the LIB localization.\n\n## Conclusion\nIn conclusion, triangulation methods have been widely used for estimating credible regions in gravitational wave events. However, their accuracy and agreement with other methods have been topics of research. The inclusion of phase consistency information in timing-triangulation techniques can bring average predictions to better agreement. Bayesian methods have been used to compare networks of second-generation ground-based detectors and provide the most accurate results and smallest confidence regions.\n\n## References\n[1] [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1310.7454.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1310.7454.pdf)\n[2] [https://in2p3.hal.science/in2p3-00807196v1/file/lrr-2016-1.pdf](https://in2p3.hal.science/in2p3-00807196v1/file/lrr-2016-1.pdf)\n[3] [https://arxiv.org/html/2404.16949v1](https://arxiv.org/html/2404.16949v1)\n[4] [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258105771_Comparison_of_Gravitational_Wave_Detector_Network_Sky_Localization_Approximations](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258105771_Comparison_of_Gravitational_Wave_Detector_Network_Sky_Localization_Approximations)\n[5] [https://dcc.ligo.org/LIGO-P1400232/public](https://dcc.ligo.org/LIGO-P1400232/public)\n[6] [https://gwosc.org/events/GW150914/](https://gwosc.org/events/GW150914/)", "marvel_standard_score": 7, "marvel_deepsearch_answer": "KEY_FACTS\n\n<TASK_OUTPUT> KEY_FACTS\n\nTriangulation methods use differences in arrival times and phases of gravitational waves at different detectors to estimate the sky location of the source [1].\nThe timing triangulation (TT) method considers time and phase, and its calculation of timing uncertainty is given by Eq.

Recent studies have explored the application of importance sampling and deep learning techniques to improve the accuracy of credible region estimation in gravitational wave events, particularly in relation to triangulation methods [@\"url:https://inspirehep.net/literature/2928671\"]. The findings suggest that the most sophisticated techniques, which perform a coherent Bayesian analysis, provide the most accurate results and smallest confidence regions [@\"url:https://arxiv.org/pdf/1310.7454\"].

A study used both BAYESTAR and LALINFERENCE to analyze the potential, resulting in a median area of the 90% credible region of 632 deg^2 and a median searched area of 132 deg^2 [@\"url:https://dcc.ligo.org/LIGO-P1400232/public\"].

The results show that the 90% credible level contours for each algorithm in equatorial coordinates, with the orthographic projection centered on the centroid of the LIB localization. The incorporation of phase coherence in time-and-phase triangulation methods can provide more robust results, particularly in the presence of detector noise, but its implementation can be challenging and requires precise control of systematic errors [@\"url:https://arxiv.org/html/2506.14179\"]. The specific advantages and limitations of using time-and-phase triangulation in conjunction with Bayesian methods for estimating credible regions in gravitational wave events are as follows: timing triangulation alone tends to over-estimate the uncertainty in sky localization by a median factor of 4 for a set of signals from non-spinning compact object binaries ranging up to a total mass of \n20\n𝑀\n⊙\n20M\n⊙\n\t​\n\n [@\"url:https://arxiv.org/pdf/1310.7454.pdf\"], the over-estimation increases with the mass of the system, average predictions can be brought to better agreement by the inclusion of phase consistency information in timing-triangulation techniques [@\"url:https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258105771_Comparison_of_Gravitational_Wave_Detector_Network_Sky_Localization_Approximations\"], but even after corrections, these techniques can yield significantly different results to the full analysis on specific mock signals. The inclusion of phase consistency information in timing-triangulation techniques can improve the accuracy of estimating credible regions for gravitational wave events [@\"url:https://in2p3.hal.science/in2p3-00807196v1/file/lrr-2016-1.pdf\"].

Recent studies have also explored the application of importance sampling and deep learning techniques to improve the accuracy of credible region estimation in gravitational wave events, particularly in relation to triangulation methods. For example, a study by Alex Kolmus et al. (2022) merged Bayesian inference and deep learning by applying importance sampling on an approximate posterior generated by a deep learning model [@\"url:https://research-portal.uu.nl/files/152202732/PhysRevD.106.023032.pdf\"].

Four pipelines, namely CWB, LIB, BAYESTAR, and LALInference, produced sky localization information. The results show that the 90% credible level contours for each algorithm in equatorial coordinates, with the orthographic projection centered on the centroid of the LIB localization.\n\nRecent advancements in machine learning techniques have significantly improved the accuracy of credible region estimation in gravitational wave events. Some of the key developments include: 1. Simulation-based inference (SBI) methods: Techniques such as neural posterior estimation (NPE), neural ratio estimation (NRE), neural likelihood estimation (NLE), flow matching (FM), and consistency models (CM) have been developed to enhance gravitational wave parameter estimation. 2. Deep learning approaches: Deep artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been constructed to localize simulated gravitational wave signals, improving the accuracy of credible region estimation. 3.

This research, published in [Astronomy Reports](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S1063772916040107) (Volume 60, pages 563–578, June 2016), analyzed radial distributions of galaxies in the COSMOS and HDF-N deep fields using independent spectral and photometric surveys. The study found a positive correlation in fluctuations between independent surveys of the same deep field, supporting the existence of fluctuations with sizes of up to 1000 Mpc and amplitudes of up to 20% at redshifts $z \\sim 2$.\n\n### Cosmological Implications and Gamma-Ray Bursts\n\nOther research has focused on the cosmological implications of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and their use as tests for basic cosmological relations.

This approach is based on observations and is used to test the validity of the PhDEC model [1]. The high-redshift Hubble diagram is derived from the fundamental distance–flux–redshift relation for general Friedmann models, given by \n𝑑\n𝐹\n(\n𝑧\n)\n=\n𝑐\n(\n1\n+\n𝑧\n)\n𝐻\n0\n∫\n0\n𝑧\n𝑑\n𝑧\n′\nΩ\n𝑀\n(\n1\n+\n𝑧\n′\n)\n3\n+\nΩ\nΛ\nd\nF\n\t​\n\n(z)=\nH\n0\n\t​\n\nc(1+z)\n\t​\n\n∫\n0\nz\n\t​\n\nΩ\nM\n\t​\n\n(1+z\n′\n)\n3\n+Ω\nΛ\n\t​\n\n\t​\n\ndz\n′\n\t​\n\n [2].\n\nGamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) and Supernovae Type Ia (SNe Ia)\n\nThe authors have also utilized Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) calibrated against Supernovae Type Ia (SNe Ia) as a cosmological probe.

This response function describes how effectively the detector can pick up gravitational waves of different polarizations and directions.\n\n### Key Parameters Involved:\n\n1. **Polarization States**: Gravitational waves have two polarization states, often referred to as the \"plus\" (+) and \"cross\" (×) polarizations. The response of a detector to these polarizations can vary based on its orientation and configuration.\n\n2. **Detector Orientation**: The physical layout and orientation of the detector (e.g., LIGO's L-shaped arms) play a crucial role in its sensitivity. The angle of the incoming gravitational wave relative to the detector's arms affects how much strain the wave induces in the detector.\n\n3. **Antenna Pattern Function**: The sensitivity of a detector to gravitational waves from a particular direction is described by the antenna pattern function \\( F_+ \\) and \\( F_\\times \\), which correspond to the two polarization states. These functions depend on the angle \\( \\theta \\) (the angle between the wave's propagation direction and the normal to the detector plane) and the polarization angle \\( \\psi \\) (the angle that describes the orientation of the polarization states).\n\n   The response of the detector to a gravitational wave can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   h(t) = F_+(t) h_+(t) + F_\\times(t) h_\\times(t)\n   \\]\n   where \\( h_+ \\) and \\( h_\\times \\) are the strain amplitudes of the plus and cross polarizations, respectively.\n\n4. **Strain Sensitivity**: The overall sensitivity of the detector is often expressed in terms of the strain sensitivity \\( h_{\\text{sens}}(f) \\), which is a function of frequency \\( f \\). This sensitivity is influenced by the detector's noise characteristics and the response functions to different polarizations.\n\n5. **Sky Location**: The position of the source in the sky (described by right ascension and declination) also affects the sensitivity, as it determines the angle \\( \\theta \\) and the polarization angle \\( \\psi \\).\n\n### Quantifying Sensitivity:\n\nTo quantify the sensitivity of a gravitational wave detector to a specific source, one typically calculates the effective strain sensitivity as a function of frequency, taking into account the antenna pattern functions. The effective sensitivity can be expressed as:\n\\[\nh_{\\text{eff}}(f) = \\sqrt{(F_+^2 + F_\\times^2) \\cdot S_h(f)}\n\\]\nwhere \\( S_h(f) \\) is the one-sided power spectral density of the detector's noise.\n\n### Summary:\n\nIn summary, the sensitivity of a gravitational wave detector in relation to the direction of polarization is quantified using the antenna pattern functions, which depend on the detector's orientation, the polarization states of the gravitational waves, and the source's location in the sky. The overall sensitivity is influenced by the detector's noise characteristics and is expressed in terms of effective strain sensitivity across different frequencies.", "gpt4o_mini_score": 9,

The detector sensitivity can be characterized by averaging over all four angles $(\\theta, \\phi, \\iota, \\xi)$. The strain induced by a GW may be written as $h_{ij} = A_+H_{+ij} \\cos (2\\pi ft) + A_\\times H_{\\times ij} \\cos (2\\pi ft + \\Delta\\phi)$.

The sensitivity is quantified in relation to the direction of polarization through the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for both intensity $I$ and circular polarization $V$. The expression for the SNR allows us to determine the distance between the two observatories which maximizes the signal to noise for circular polarization. The parameters involved in this calculation include orientation, alignment, and separation between two detectors. The polarization states of gravitational waves are characterized by the Stokes parameters $I$, $V$, and $(Q \\pm iU)$. Other parameters include the noise properties of the detector, such as those described for LISA and BBO, and the power spectrum $S_h$ of the gravitational wave. The wave number $k$ is set by the parameters of the model. Additionally, the directional sensitivity of the detector is not completely represented by either a cross or plus polarized antenna pattern. The definition of polarization is dependent on the source location. The distance from the origin to the surface in any direction is proportional to the detector's sensitivity in that direction. The response to GWs is given by $F_a(f)$, and the optical transfer function is $G(f)$. The phase difference is $\\Delta \\varphi = (h_+ F_+(f) - h_\\times F_\\times(f))G(f)$. The sky-averaged response, where the response is integrated over the whole sky, is also used to quantify the sensitivity of a GW observatory. The sensitivity function of a gravitational wave detector can be obtained by averaging over all-sky wave source positions, based on the Michelson data combination. The parameters involved in this calculation also include polarization angle ($\\psi$), right ascension (RA), declination (dec), and time ($t_c$), collectively denoted by $\\xi:=({\\rm RA},{\\rm dec},\\psi,t_{c})$. The sensitivity of a gravitational wave detector to the two independent polarization states, denoted as $+$ and $\\times$, depends on the relative orientations of the source and detector. A general signal can be described as a linear combination of the two polarization states: $h = A_+h_+ + A_\\times h_\\times$. The sensitivity of a gravitational wave detector to stochastic backgrounds of different polarizations is quantified by the overlap reduction functions, which encode the sensitivity of detector pairs to isotropic backgrounds of each polarization.

The noise properties of gravitational wave detectors, such as LISA and BBO, affect the calculation of sensitivity to different polarization states by: * Impacting the detector's ability to distinguish between different polarization states * Averaging over wave polarization, sky position, and DNS orientation * Influencing the overlap reduction function, which is normalized by $(8\\pi/5)\\sin^2\\beta$ [1] [https://dcc.ligo.org/LIGO-P1400129/public](https://dcc.ligo.org/LIGO-P1400129/public) [2] [https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevX.7.041058](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevX.7.041058) [3] [https://dcc-llo.ligo.org/public/0027/T050136/000/T050136-00.pdf](https://dcc-llo.ligo.org/public/0027/T050136/000/T050136-00.pdf) [4] [https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.100.044042](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.100.044042) [5] [https://arxiv.org/html/2503.09627v1](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.09627v1) [6] [https://s3.cern.ch/inspire-prod-files-c/cca429e4224f173f244bb7c723e08df7](https://s3.cern.ch/inspire-prod-files-c/cca429e4224f173f244bb7c723e08df7) [7] [https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6382/ad694d/pdf](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6382/ad694d/pdf) [8] [https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/1910.13436.pdf](https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/1910.13436.pdf) [9] [https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/1408.0740.pdf](https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/1408.0740.pdf) [10] [https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/1811.08797.pdf](https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/1811.08797.pdf) [11] [https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/1911.09745.pdf](https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/1911.09745.pdf) [12] [https://dcc.ligo.org/LIGO-T1900468/public](https://dcc.ligo.org/LIGO-T1900468/public) [13] [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.01193.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.01193.pdf) [14] [https://arxiv.org/html/2407.13590v2](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.13590v2) [15] [https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0264-9381/33/8/085007/ampdf](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0264-9381/33/8/085007/ampdf) [16] [https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0264-9381/32/1/015014.pdf](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0264-9381/32/1/015014) [17] [https://s3.cern.ch/inspire-prod-files-c/cca429e4224f173f244bb7c723e08df7](https://s3.cern.ch/inspire-prod-files-c/cca429e4224f173f244bb7c723e08df7) [18] [https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2023/01/aa45205-22/aa45205-22.html](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2023/01/aa45205-22/aa45205-22.html) [19] [https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.98.022008.pdf](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.98.022008.pdf)\nREFERENCES\n\n<TASK_OUTPUT>\n\nhttps://dcc.ligo.org/LIGO-P1400129/public\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevX.7.041058\nhttps://dcc-llo.ligo.org/public/0027/T050136/000/T050136-00.pdf\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.100.044042\nhttps://arxiv.org/html/2503.09627v1\nhttps://s3.cern.ch/inspire-prod-files-c/cca429e4224f173f244bb7c723e08df7\nhttps://dcc.ligo.org/LIGO-G1100880/public\nhttps://dcc.ligo.org/LIGO-T1400017/public\nhttps://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6382/abd4f6/ampdf\nhttps://www.emis.de/journals/LRG/Articles/lrr-2013-9/articlese3.html\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.09139.pdf\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/gr-qc/0605100\nhttps://theses.hal.science/tel-04220715v2/file/CANO_2022_archivage.pdf\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.77.103001.pdf\nhttps://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6382/ad694d/pdf\nhttps://www.arxiv.org/pdf/1910.13436.pdf\nhttps://www.arxiv.org/pdf/1911.09745.pdf\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.01193.pdf\nhttps://arxiv.org/html/2504.01809v1\nhttps://dcc.ligo.org/LIGO-T1900468/public\nhttps://arxiv.org/html/2407.13590v2\nhttps://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0264-9381/33/8/085007/ampdf\nhttps://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0264-9381/32/1/015014.pdf\nhttps://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2023/01/aa45205-22/aa45205-22.html\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.98.022008.pdf </TASK_OUTPUT>", "marvel_deepsearch_score": 8, "evaluation_model_type": "openai", "evaluation_model_name": "gpt-4o-mini", "qa_model_type": "openai", "qa_model_name": "gpt-4o-mini", "gpt4o_mini_answer_relevancy": 0.98, "gpt4o_mini_answer_correctness": 0.85, "gpt4o_mini_faithfulness": 0.95, "marvel_standard_answer_relevancy": 0.95, "marvel_standard_answer_correctness": 0.7, "marvel_standard_faithfulness": 0.9, "marvel_deepsearch_answer_relevancy": 0.98, "marvel_deepsearch_answer_correctness": 0.87, "marvel_deepsearch_faithfulness": 0.92}

Stars with higher metallicity tend to have stronger stellar winds, leading to greater mass loss over their lifetimes. This can result in lower final masses when they collapse into black holes.\n   - **Core Collapse**: In low-metallicity environments, massive stars can retain more of their mass until they reach the end of their nuclear burning phases. This can lead to the formation of more massive black holes, as these stars can collapse with a larger core mass.\n\n2. **Upper Mass Limit for Black Holes**:\n   - The upper mass limit for black holes formed from very low metallicity stars is still a subject of research, but it is generally believed that these black holes can be significantly more massive than those formed from higher metallicity stars. Estimates suggest that black holes formed from very low metallicity stars (like those found in the early universe) could reach masses of around 30 to 50 solar masses or even higher, potentially up to 100 solar masses or more in some scenarios.\n   - The exact upper limit is influenced by various factors, including the initial mass of the progenitor star, the efficiency of mass loss through stellar winds, and the dynamics of the supernova explosion (if it occurs) or direct collapse into a black hole.\n\nIn summary, lower metallicity allows massive stars to retain more mass, potentially leading to the formation of more massive black holes, with estimates suggesting that black holes from very low metallicity stars could exceed 100 solar masses under certain conditions.", "gpt4o_mini_score": 9, "marvel_standard_answer": "\nThe estimated upper mass limit for black holes formed from stars with very low metallicity is potentially >80 M_{\\odot}.\n\n\n**Note:** This is a quick response generated by a language model, which may contain inaccuracies. \n                                                    For more detailed answers, please rephrase your question and be sure to request sources and supporting documents.\n                                                    ", "marvel_standard_score": 4, "marvel_deepsearch_answer": "KEY_FACTS\nMetallicity significantly affects the mass of black holes formed from massive stars.

This phenomenon has been studied by experts in the field, and various scenarios have been proposed to explain the relationship between dark matter accumulation and the formation of black holes.\n\n## Introduction\n---------------\n\nDark matter is a type of matter that does not emit, absorb, or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, making it invisible to our telescopes. Despite its elusive nature, dark matter's presence can be inferred through its gravitational effects on visible matter. The accumulation of dark matter in a star can have significant consequences, including the potential formation of a black hole.\n\n## The Collapse of a Star into a Black Hole\n--------------------------------------\n\nThe explosive process that can be triggered by the accumulation of dark matter in a star, potentially leading to the formation of a black hole, is the collapse of the star into a black hole through the capture of dark matter. This process can occur when dark matter accumulates in the core of a star, such as a helium white dwarf, and collapses to form a black hole. The dark matter can interact with the stellar material through scattering, leading to the transfer of energy and the potential for thermonuclear fusion. However, in the case of helium white dwarfs, this process does not lead to a thermonuclear explosion, but rather to the formation of a black hole.\n\n## The Process of Dark Matter Accumulation\n--------------------------------------\n\nThe accumulation of dark matter in a star can lead to the formation of a black hole through the following process:\n\n* Dark matter particles with mass $m_\\chi \\gtrsim10^6$ GeV interact with the star through scattering, leading to the accumulation of dark matter in the core of the star.\n* The mass capture rate of dark matter by a helium white dwarf is given by $\\dot{M}_{\\rm WD}^{\\rm cap} = m_\\chi \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty C_n$, where $C_n$ are rates for dark matter to be captured after $n$ scatters.\n* The dark matter accumulates in a central region of the star, forming a thermalized sphere in virial equilibrium.\n* Once enough dark matter accumulates, it becomes unstable to small perturbations and collapses to form a black hole.\n\n## Relevant Dark Matter Mass Range\n------------------------------\n\nThe relevant dark matter mass range for this process to occur is $m_\\chi > \\mathcal{O}(10^7)$ GeV.\n\n## Different Scenarios\n-------------------\n\nSeveral scenarios have been proposed to explain the relationship between dark matter accumulation and the formation of black holes. These include:\n\n* The accumulation of dark matter in a neutron star can potentially trigger a massive explosion, which may lead to the formation of a black hole. [1]\n* The accumulation of dark matter in a star can trigger an explosive process, potentially leading to the formation of a black hole, through a scenario involving the transmutation of neutron stars by gravitational collapse. [2]\n* The accumulation of dark matter in a star can lead to the formation of a black hole, potentially explaining the existence of near- and sub-solar-mass black holes, as black holes may form and grow quietly inside stars. [3]\n* The accumulation of dark matter in a star can trigger an explosive process, specifically type Ia explosions, which is a phenomenon related to the formation of a black hole. [4]\n\n## Conclusion\n----------\n\nThe accumulation of dark matter in a star can trigger an explosive process, potentially leading to the formation of a black hole. Various scenarios have been proposed to explain this phenomenon, and further research is needed to understand the relationship between dark matter accumulation and the formation of black holes.\n\n## References\n--------------\n\n* [1] [Dark matter could be building up inside dead stars with potentially explosive consequences](https://www.livescience.com/physics-mathematics/dark-matter/dark-matter-could-be-building-up-inside-dead-stars-with-potentially-explosive-consequences)\n* [2] [arXiv:2112.09716](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.09716)\n* [3] [Black holes can form silently in stars](https://phys.org/news/2025-05-black-holes-stars-silently.html)\n* [4] [Dark matter may power supernovae](https://physicsworld.com/a/dark-matter-may-power-supernovae/)\n* [arXiv:2405.12277v2](https://arxiv.org/html/2405.12277v2)", "marvel_standard_score": 7, "marvel_deepsearch_answer": "KEY_FACTS\n\n<TASK_OUTPUT>\n\nThe explosive process triggered by dark matter accumulation in a star involves the collapse into a black hole.\nDark matter accumulates in the core of a star, such as a helium white dwarf, and collapses to form a black hole on a timescale of around \n10\n14\n10\n14\n years [@\"url:https://arxiv.org/html/2405.12277v2\"].\nThe process involves dark matter particles with mass \n𝑚\n𝜒\n≳\n10\n6\nm\nχ\n\t​\n\n≳10\n6\n GeV interacting with the star through scattering.\nThe relevant dark matter mass range is \n𝑚\n𝜒\n>\n𝑂\n(\n10\n7\n)\nm\nχ\n\t​\n\n>O(10\n7\n) GeV.\nThe accumulation of dark matter can lead to type Ia supernovae explosions and quiet formation of black holes inside stars.\nSeveral scenarios explain the relationship between dark matter accumulation and black hole formation, including collapse through dark matter capture, triggering massive explosions in neutron stars, and quiet black hole formation inside stars [@\"url:https://www.livescience.com/physics-mathematics/dark-matter/dark-matter-could-be-building-up-inside-dead-stars-with-potentially-explosive-consequences\"; \"url:https://physicsworld.com/a/dark-matter-may-power-supernovae/\"; \"url:https://phys.org/news/2025-05-black-holes-stars-silently.html\"].\nDark matter accumulation can impact stellar stability, potentially leading to quiet black hole formation.\nThe presence of dark matter in neutron stars can modify their properties and stability, depending on the dark matter particle mass \n𝑚\n𝜒\nm\nχ\n\t​\n\n [@\"url:https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2214404825000084\"].\nObservational consequences of dark matter in neutron stars include influencing the mass-radius relation, affecting tidal deformability, and modifying gravitational wave signals [@\"url:https://arxiv.org/html/2408.01006v1\"]. </TASK_OUTPUT>\nFINER_DETAILS\n\n<TASK_OUTPUT> The accumulation of dark matter in a star can trigger an explosive process, potentially leading to the formation of a black hole, through several scenarios.

This process enables the star to undergo an interaction that processes Carbon into Oxygen, resulting in a more violent explosion.

This phenomenon has been studied by experts in the field, and various scenarios have been proposed to explain the relationship between dark matter accumulation and the formation of black holes. The accumulation of dark matter in a star can lead to the formation of a black hole through the collapse of the star into a black hole through the capture of dark matter. This process can occur when dark matter accumulates in the core of a star, such as a helium white dwarf, and collapses to form a black hole. The timescale for this process to occur is around $10^{14}$ years.

The accumulation of dark matter in a neutron star can affect its stability and potential for triggering a massive explosion by heating up the star, altering its natural cooling, and potentially triggering a \"superburst\" or collapse into a black hole. The accumulation of dark matter can also influence the mass-radius relation, tidal deformability, and gravitational wave signal emitted during a binary neutron star merger. A critical amount of dark matter accumulation can lead to the collapse of the neutron star into a black hole, with some studies suggesting that only a small amount of dark matter, such as an asteroid-sized amount, is needed to trigger this process. The relevant dark matter mass range for this process to occur is $m_\\chi > \\mathcal{O}(10^7)$ GeV. The accumulation of dark matter in a star can trigger an explosive process, specifically type Ia explosions, which is a phenomenon related to the formation of a black hole. Recent studies have proposed various scenarios to explain this phenomenon, and further research is needed to understand the relationship between dark matter accumulation and the formation of black holes. [1] [Dark matter could be building up inside dead stars with potentially explosive consequences](https://www.livescience.com/physics-mathematics/dark-matter/dark-matter-could-be-building-up-inside-dead-stars-with-potentially-explosive-consequences) [2] [arXiv:2112.09716](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.09716) [3] [Black holes can form silently in stars](https://phys.org/news/2025-05-black-holes-stars-silently.html) [4] [Dark matter may power supernovae](https://physicsworld.com/a/dark-matter-may-power-supernovae/) [arXiv:2405.12277v2](https://arxiv.org/html/2405.12277v2) The accumulation of dark matter within stars can significantly impact their stability and potentially lead to quiet black hole formation. This phenomenon has been explored in various studies, shedding light on the complex interactions between dark matter and stellar evolution. The effect of dark matter accumulation on the stability of a star is non-intuitive, as adding more matter to a meta-stable star, specifically a non-interacting non-relativistic fluid, tends to stabilize the configuration rather than tipping it closer to collapse [1]. This increased stability arises from the dark matter acting as a source of non-relativistic stress. The presence of dark matter can also raise the critical central density beyond which the star suffers the Feynman-Chandrasekhar instability [1]. The presence of dark matter in neutron stars, referred to as Dark Matter Admixed Neutron Stars (DANS), can modify their properties and stability [2]. Specifically, the effects of DM on stellar properties depend on the dark matter particle mass $m_\\chi$. For $m_\\chi=1$ GeV, the stellar gravitational maximum mass $M_{max}$ decreases, whereas for $m_\\chi=0.1$ GeV, $M_{max}$ increases with respect to the maximum mass of ordinary neutron stars [2]. The existence of dark matter within neutron stars has been hypothesized to have several observational consequences, including influencing the mass-radius relation, affecting the tidal deformability, and potentially modifying the gravitational wave signal emitted during a binary neutron star merger [3]. Dark matter could also cause gravitational lensing or alteration of the pulsar pulse profile due to extra light-bending in a dark halo [4]. The accumulation of dark matter inside young stars can generate enough energy to prevent them from cooling down, potentially transforming them into long-lived, stable objects known as dark dwarfs [5]. Alternatively, dark matter accumulation can lead to quiet black hole formation, a process that may be influenced by the annihilation between dark matter particles [6]. Further research is needed to fully understand the complex interactions between dark matter and stellar evolution.\nREFERENCES\n\n<TASK_OUTPUT>\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/html/2405.12277v2\nhttps://www.livescience.com/physics-mathematics/dark-matter/dark-matter-could-be-building-up-inside-dead-stars-with-potentially-explosive-consequences\nhttps://theconversation.com/dark-stars-dark-matter-may-form-exploding-stars-and-observing-the-damage-could-help-reveal-what-its-made-of-226262\nhttps://phys.org/news/2025-05-black-holes-stars-silently.html\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.110.083004\nhttps://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/29852/the-role-of-dark-matter-in-black-holes-and-star-formation\nhttps://physicsworld.com/a/dark-matter-may-power-supernovae/\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2112.09716\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06078\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.97.123007\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.100.043020\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.111.043016\nhttps://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/528/4/6319/7596569\nhttps://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1996ApJ...456...71M\nhttps://astrobites.org/2024/07/27/darkheart\nhttps://arxiv.org/html/2406.13887v1\nhttps://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1996ApJ...456...71M\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2214404825000084\nhttps://www.epj-conferences.org/articles/epjconf/pdf/2022/18/epjconf_confxv2022_07009.pdf\nhttps://scitechdaily.com/these-stars-dont-burn-they-annihilate-dark-matter\nhttps://arxiv.org/html/2408.01006v1\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.111.043016.pdf\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.110.083035.pdf\nhttps://arxiv.org/html/2406.13887v1\nhttps://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1996ApJ...456...71M\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2214404825000084\nhttps://www.epj-conferences.org/articles/epjconf/pdf/2022/18/epjconf_confxv2022_07009.pdf\nhttps://scitechdaily.com/these-stars-dont-burn-they-annihilate-dark-matter\nhttps://arxiv.org/html/2408.01006v1 </TASK_OUTPUT>", "marvel_deepsearch_score": 9, "evaluation_model_type": "openai", "evaluation_model_name": "gpt-4o-mini", "qa_model_type": "openai", "qa_model_name": "gpt-4o-mini", "gpt4o_mini_answer_relevancy": 0.92, "gpt4o_mini_answer_correctness": 0.85, "gpt4o_mini_faithfulness": 0.8, "marvel_standard_answer_relevancy": 0.98, "marvel_standard_answer_correctness": 0.9, "marvel_standard_faithfulness": 0.92, "marvel_deepsearch_answer_relevancy": 0.92, "marvel_deepsearch_answer_correctness": 0.87, "marvel_deepsearch_faithfulness": 0.92}

This article provides an overview of the identifiers for gravitational wave events and the instruments used to observe them.\n\n## Introduction to Gravitational Wave Observations\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nThe Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) and Virgo are among the primary instruments used for the direct detection of gravitational waves. LIGO consists of two L-shaped interferometers, each 4 kilometers in length, separated by 1,865 miles. These interferometers detect minute distortions, with a stretching effect of just one-ten-thousandth the diameter of a proton.\n\n## Gravitational Wave Events and Identifiers\n-----------------------------------------\n\nThe identifiers for gravitational wave events follow a specific naming convention, starting with the prefix \"GW\" for confirmed events and \"S\" for observations that trigger an event alert but have not yet been confirmed. Some of the notable gravitational wave events include:\n\n* GW150914: The first observed gravitational wave event, which occurred on September 14, 2015, at approximately 5:51 a.m. EDT.\n* GW151226: A gravitational wave event observed during the first observing run (O1) of LIGO, with masses of 14.2 and 7.5 solar masses, and occurring at a distance of 1.4 billion light years.\n* GW170104, GW170608, GW170814, and GW170817: Events observed during the second observing run (O2) of LIGO and Virgo.\n* GW190412, GW190521, GW190814, and GW200105: More recent gravitational wave events observed by LIGO and Virgo.\n\n## Instruments Used for Observations\n--------------------------------------\n\nThe instruments used to observe gravitational waves include:\n\n* LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory): Consists of two L-shaped interferometers, one located in Hanford, Washington, and the other in Livingston, Louisiana.\n* Virgo: A gravitational wave detector located in Cascina, Italy.\n* Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope's Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM) instrument: Used to detect gamma-ray bursts associated with gravitational wave events.\n* INTEGRAL telescope's all-sky SPI-ACS instrument: Used to detect gamma-ray bursts associated with gravitational wave events.\n\n## Detection Methods and Sensitivity\n--------------------------------------\n\nThe detection of gravitational waves involves measuring vibrations on a 4 km scale, down to a very small order of magnitude of 1/10,000 the width of a proton. The sensitivity of LIGO and Virgo has improved over time, with Livingston achieving 15-25% sensitivity improvement over O1 during the second observing run (O2).\n\n## Conclusion\n----------\n\nThe observation of gravitational waves has opened a new window into the universe, allowing us to study cosmic phenomena in ways previously impossible. The identifiers for gravitational wave events and the instruments used to observe them are crucial in understanding the properties of these events and the astrophysical processes that produce them.\n\nSources:\n\n* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_observation_of_gravitational_waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_observation_of_gravitational_waves)\n* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational-wave_observatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational-wave_observatory)\n* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_gravitational_wave_observations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_gravitational_wave_observations)\n* [https://astrobites.org/2023/11/08/guide-to-gravitational-waves/](https://astrobites.org/2023/11/08/guide-to-gravitational-waves/)\n* [https://science.mit.edu/big-stories/detecting-gravitational-waves/](https://science.mit.edu/big-stories/detecting-gravitational-waves/)\n* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIGO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIGO)\n* [https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/13782/what-did-ligo-actually-see-gravitational-waves-discovery](https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/13782/what-did-ligo-actually-see-gravitational-waves-discovery)", "marvel_standard_score": 8, "marvel_deepsearch_answer": "The identifiers for the gravitational wave events mentioned in the context and the instruments used to observe them are detailed below.\n\nIdentifiers and Instruments\nGW150914: Observed using Earth-based LIGO, Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope's GBM, and INTEGRAL telescope's SPI-ACS.\nGW151226: Detected using LIGO.\nGW170104, GW170608, GW170814, GW170817: Detected using LIGO and Virgo.\nGW190412, GW190521, GW190814, GW200105: Mentioned but specific instruments not detailed in the query context.\nS190421ar, S190425z: Observed using Virgo and LIGO's Hanford site.\nGW191103_012549: Observed using LIGO and Virgo.\nGW250114: Detected on January 14, 2025, by the NSF LIGO Hanford detector, involving colliding black holes about 1.3 billion light-years away with masses between 30 to 40 times that of our Sun.\nConclusion\n\nThe identifiers for the gravitational wave events mentioned include but are not limited to:\n\nGW150914\nGW151226\nGW170104\nGW170608\nGW170814\nGW170817\nGW190412\nGW190521\nGW190814\nGW200105\nGW191103_012549\nGW250114\nS190421ar\nS190425z\n\nThe instruments used to observe these events include:\n\nLIGO (including Hanford site)\nVirgo\nFermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope's Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM)\nINTEGRAL telescope's all-sky SPI-ACS\nSpecific LIGO and Virgo Detector Configurations\n\nThe LIGO and Virgo detector configurations used for observing gravitational wave events between 2015 and 2025 are as follows:\n\nObservation Runs:\n\nO1 and O2 (2015-2017): Two LIGO detectors.\nO2 and O3 (2017-2020): Two LIGO detectors and Virgo.\nO3 (April 2019 -

Here’s a general outline of the process:\n\n1. **Identify the Largest Side**: Determine the dimensions of the cube (length, width, height) and identify which side is the longest.\n\n2. **Split the Cube**: Once the largest side is identified, the cube is split into two smaller cubes (or rectangular prisms) along the midpoint of that side. This can be done by creating a plane that bisects the cube along the longest dimension.\n\n3. **Recursion**: After splitting, the algorithm recursively applies the same process to each of the resulting smaller cubes.

It is designed to scan large portions of the sky to detect and study transient phenomena, such as supernovae and other variable objects.\n\n## Instrument and Survey Capabilities\nThe ZTF uses a camera with a 47 square degree field of view mounted on the Samuel Oschin 48-inch Schmidt telescope. This setup allows it to scan more than 3750 square degrees per hour to a depth of 20.5 mag [1]. The ZTF camera consists of 16 CCDs of 6144 x 6160 pixels each, enabling it to cover an area of 47 square degrees per exposure [2].\n\n## Magnitude Limit and Patrolled Volume\nThe ZTF has a typical magnitude limit of $g \\sim20.8$ and $r \\sim20.6$ mag (AB, $5\\sigma$ in 30 sec) [3][4]. It patrols a volume of 47 square degrees using a 47 square degree field with a 600 megapixel camera, scanning the entire northern visible sky at rates of $\\sim3760$ square degrees/hour [3]. The survey covers approximately 25,000 to 30,000 square degrees of the Northern sky visible from Palomar Observatory [5].\n\n## Survey Goals and Performance\nThe main aim of the ZTF is to discover young supernovae and other types of transients [2]. With its current strategy, the ZTF survey provides nearly 300 observations each year per object in the northern hemisphere [2]. The ZTF Bright Transient Survey aims to spectroscopically classify every extragalactic transient brighter than 18.5 mag that occurs within ZTF's 14,000 square degree active footprint [6].\n\n## Performance and Results\nThe ZTF has observed a large sample of SNe from an untargeted, rolling survey, reaching magnitudes of 20.8, 20.6, and 20.3 mag in $g$, $r$, and $i$ bands, respectively [7]. The ZTF Data Release 2 (DR2) allows for the search and classification of variables down to $r \\sim20.6$ mag [8].\n\n## References\n[1] [https://www.astropix.org/provider/ztf](https://www.astropix.org/provider/ztf)\n[2] [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zwicky_Transient_Facility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zwicky_Transient_Facility)\n[3] [https://iopscience.iop.org/journal/1538-3873/page/Zwicky-Transient-Facility](https://iopscience.iop.org/journal/1538-3873/page/Zwicky-Transient-Facility)\n[4] [http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019PASP..131a8003M/abstract](http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019PASP..131a8003M/abstract)\n[5] [https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/Missions/ztf.html](https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/Missions/ztf.html)\n[6] [https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021AAS...23750903P/abstract](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021AAS...23750903P/abstract)\n[7] [https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/510/2/2228/6425769](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/510/2/2228/6425769)\n[8] [https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4365/ab9cae](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4365/ab9cae)", "marvel_standard_score": 8, "marvel_deepsearch_answer": "The Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) operating at Palomar Observatory has a typical magnitude limit of approximately \n20.5\n20.5 to \n20.8\n20.8 mag, and it patrols a volume of about \n47\n47 square degrees per exposure, with a scanning rate of \n∼\n3750\n∼3750 to \n3760\n3760 square degrees per hour.\n\nThe ZTF uses a camera with a 47 square degree field of view mounted on the Samuel Oschin 48-inch Schmidt telescope.

Additionally, the parameter δ hat φ_{9ℓ} shows that for 4pn and 4.5pn, the bounds yield values less than or equal to O(1), which is significant given the enhanced sensitivity of detectors like AdvLIGO.", "gpt4o_mini_answer": "In gravitational wave detection, the ability to accurately measure and characterize binary systems—whether symmetric (equal masses) or asymmetric (unequal masses)—is influenced by several factors. Here are the key factors that contribute to the better bounds of asymmetric binaries compared to symmetric binaries:\n\n1. **Signal Amplitude and Frequency Evolution**:\n   - Asymmetric binaries, where one black hole or neutron star is significantly more massive than the other, produce gravitational waves with different frequency evolution compared to symmetric binaries. The frequency of the gravitational waves increases more rapidly in asymmetric systems, which can lead to stronger signals in the frequency band of interest for detectors like LIGO and Virgo.\n\n2. **Parameter Estimation**:\n   - The parameter estimation for asymmetric binaries tends to be more robust due to the distinct features in the waveform. The mass ratio affects the phase evolution of the gravitational waves, leading to a richer structure in the waveform that can be more easily distinguished from noise. This can improve the accuracy of parameter estimation, such as the masses and spins of the components.\n\n3. **Higher Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)**:\n   - Asymmetric binaries can produce higher SNRs in certain configurations, especially when the mass ratio is significantly different (e.g., a black hole and a neutron star). The stronger gravitational wave signal can lead to better detection capabilities and more precise measurements.\n\n4. **Diverse Waveform Models**:\n   - The waveforms from asymmetric binaries can be more complex, allowing for a wider variety of models to be tested against the data. This diversity can help in distinguishing the signal from noise and improving the overall detection and parameter estimation process.\n\n5. **Chirp Mass Sensitivity**:\n   - The chirp mass, which is a combination of the masses of the binary components, plays a crucial role in the gravitational wave signal. Asymmetric binaries can have a more pronounced chirp mass effect, which can enhance the detectability of the signal.\n\n6. **Post-Merger Signals**:\n   - In cases where the binary components are significantly different in mass, the post-merger phase (if applicable) can also provide additional information. The dynamics of the merger and the resulting remnant (e.g., a black hole or neutron star) can lead to different gravitational wave signatures that can be detected.\n\n### Comparison to Symmetric Binaries:\n\n- **Symmetric binaries** (equal masses) produce gravitational waves that have a simpler structure, which can make them easier to model but may also lead to degeneracies in parameter estimation. The lack of distinct features in the waveform can make it harder to extract precise information about the individual masses and spins.\n\n- **Asymmetric binaries** benefit from the differences in mass, which create more complex waveforms and allow for better discrimination between different models. This complexity can lead to improved bounds on the parameters of the system, such as mass ratios and spins.\n\nIn summary, the better bounds of asymmetric binaries in gravitational wave detection arise from their unique waveform characteristics, higher SNR, and the ability to provide more information through their complex dynamics.

Asymmetric binaries exhibit a greater likelihood of mass asymmetry, isotropic spins, and orbital eccentricity compared to symmetric binaries. According to recent studies, including those by P Kolitsidou et al. (2025) and D Singh (2023), these factors enable improved bounds for asymmetric binaries. The comparison between asymmetric and symmetric binaries highlights the significance of these factors in accurately detecting and measuring black-hole spins and gravitational wave signals.\n\nThe detection sensitivities of gravitational wave observatories for asymmetric and symmetric binaries are influenced by the mass ratio and spin misalignment. Higher mass ratios benefit spin estimation, and asymmetric systems have stronger contributions from higher multipoles. The detection sensitivities are affected by the assumptions made in current searches for gravitational waves from compact-binary objects. Specifically, 90% of detected binaries are predicted to have mass ratios \n𝑞\n<\n4\nq<4 and ∼97% of black holes in these binaries are expected to have masses less than \n45\n𝑀\n⊙\n45M\n⊙\n\t​\n\n.\n\nMultipole asymmetry and higher harmonics play a crucial role in accurately measuring black-hole spins, particularly in asymmetric binaries compared to symmetric binaries. Neglecting these factors can lead to biased measurements of spin magnitude and direction, especially in high signal-to-noise-ratio observations. Including them in waveform models improves the accuracy of black-hole spin measurements and is essential for unbiased parameter estimation in gravitational wave observations.\n\nThe inclusion of higher modes (\nℓ\n=\n𝑚\n=\n3\nℓ=m=3 and \nℓ\n=\n𝑚\n=\n4\nℓ=m=4) in gravitational wave searches, in addition to the dominant mode (\nℓ\n=\n𝑚\n=\n2\nℓ=m=2), significantly improves the early warning ability and localization sky-area reduction for asymmetric binaries (such as neutron star-black hole binaries) compared to symmetric binaries.

For third-generation networks, gains of up to \n1.5\n1.5 min in early warning times for a localization area of \n100\n100 sq. deg. are possible, even at \n100\n100 Mpc. These improvements are crucial for the prompt discovery of electromagnetic counterparts and maximizing the science gain from multi-messenger follow-up of GW signals.\n\nThe impact of eccentricity on the detectability of asymmetric binaries in gravitational wave detection compared to symmetric binaries is significant. For small eccentricities (\n0\n≲\n𝑒\n0\n≲\n0.05\n0≲e\n0\n\t​\n\n≲0.05), the impact on the detectability of gravitational waves from coalescing compact binaries with total mass \n2\n𝑀\n⊙\n<\n𝑀\n<\n15\n𝑀\n⊙\n2M\n⊙\n\t​\n\n<M<15M\n⊙\n\t​\n\n at \n40\n40 Hz is not significant. However, for larger eccentricities (\n𝑒\n0\n≳\n0.1\ne\n0\n\t​\n\n≳0.1), the loss in matched filter signal-to-noise ratio due to eccentricity can be significant, requiring templates that include eccentric effects for optimal searches.\n\nIn conclusion, the detection of asymmetric binaries in GW detection is crucial in understanding the unique signatures of these binaries. The factors contributing to better bounds of asymmetric binaries include the emission of gravitational waves with strong higher harmonics, multipole asymmetry, and the capability of future gravitational-wave detector networks. The comparison of asymmetric binaries to symmetric binaries highlights the advantages of detecting asymmetric binaries.\n\nReferences:\n\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.106.123003\nhttps://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/aba42d\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.111.024050\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.107.083037\nhttps://arxiv.org/html/2505.08332v1\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00813\nhttps://inspirehep.net/literature/2753953\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/368056077_Investigating_the_effect_of_in_plane_spin_directions_for_precessing_binary_black_hole_systems\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/382823220_Impact_of_Higher_Harmonics_of_Gravitational_Radiation_on_the_Population_Inference_of_Binary_Black_Holes </TASK_OUTPUT>\nREFERENCES\n\n<TASK_OUTPUT>\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/html/2505.08332v1\nhttps://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/aba42d\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.106.123003\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.111.024050\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.107.083037\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/385874152_Searching_for_Asymmetric_and_Heavily_Precessing_Binary_Black_Holes_in_the_Gravitational_Wave_Data_from_the_LIGO_Third_Observing_Run\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667325823002881\nhttps://dcc.ligo.org/LIGO-P1100198/public\nhttps://cris.maastrichtuniversity.nl/files/182943566/c8216.pdf\nhttps://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5255530\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.89.042004\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/337684792_Accuracy_of_source_localization_for_eccentric_inspiraling_binary_mergers_using_a_ground-based_detector_network\nhttps://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/abb373/epub\nhttps://inspirehep.net/literature/830028\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/343562490_Impact_of_eccentricity_on_the_gravitational-wave_searches_for_binary_black_holes_High_mass_case\nhttps://arxiv.org/html/2503.23419v3\nhttps://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/lz7k-bvjf\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/394236832_How_Do_Eccentric_Binaries_Affect_Gravitational_Waves_An_Exploration_of_Orbital_Eccentricity_in_Compact_Binary_Gravitational_Wave_Signatures\nhttps://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1394191/1/PICKARD%20thesis_nocopyright%5B1%5D.pdf\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.105.103032\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00813\nhttps://inspirehep.net/literature/2753953\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/368056077_Investigating_the_effect_of_in_plane_spin_directions_for_precessing_binary_black_hole_systems\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.111.024050\nhttps://arxiv.org/html/2412.06913v1\nhttps://arxiv.org/html/2312.07376v1\nhttps://arxiv.org/html/2312.07376v2\nhttps://www.aei.mpg.de/800394/when-precession-and-higher-harmonics-play-together\nhttps://orca.cardiff.ac.uk/id/eprint/137856/1/PhysRevD.103.024024.pdf\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.111.064009\nhttps://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024ApJ...971...23S/abstract\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.89.102003\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/382823220_Impact_of_Higher_Harmonics_of_Gravitational_Radiation_on_the_Population_Inference_of_Binary_Black_Holes\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.14571.pdf\nhttps://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/511/3/4350/6524911\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.106.103035\nhttps://inspirehep.net/literature/2128270\nhttps://orca.cardiff.ac.uk/id/eprint/142412/1/10.1103PhysRevD.103.124023%20-%20Published.pdf\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.102.043015.pdf\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/hwr5-scp4\nhttps://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...898L..39K/abstract\nhttps://inspirehep.net/literature/1796792\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.08830.pdf\nhttps://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.502.1612S/abstract\nhttps://inspirehep.net/literature/1825976\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2005.08830\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.105.043010.pdf\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.104.084080.pdf </TASK_OUTPUT>", "marvel_deepsearch_score": 8, "evaluation_model_type": "openai", "evaluation_model_name": "gpt-4o-mini", "qa_model_type": "openai", "qa_model_name": "gpt-4o-mini", "gpt4o_mini_answer_relevancy": 0.95, "gpt4o_mini_answer_correctness": 0.8, "gpt4o_mini_faithfulness": 0.05, "marvel_standard_answer_relevancy": 0.0, "marvel_standard_answer_correctness": 0.0, "marvel_standard_faithfulness": 0.0, "marvel_deepsearch_answer_relevancy": 0.92, "marvel_deepsearch_answer_correctness": 0.87, "marvel_deepsearch_faithfulness": 0.05}

Here are some of the significant insights gained from this event:\n\n1. **Electromagnetic Counterpart**: GW170817 was the first gravitational wave event to be observed alongside its electromagnetic counterpart, a kilonova. This allowed for a multi-messenger astronomy approach, combining gravitational wave data with observations across the electromagnetic spectrum. The kilonova provided evidence for the production of heavy elements, such as gold and platinum, through rapid neutron capture processes (r-process nucleosynthesis).\n\n2. **Equation of State of Neutron Stars**: The merger provided critical constraints on the equation of state (EoS) of neutron stars, which describes how matter behaves at extremely high densities. The gravitational wave signal allowed scientists to measure the masses and radii of the neutron stars involved in the merger. This information is crucial for understanding the EoS of nuclear matter, particularly in the context of dense nuclear matter where traditional models may not apply.\n\n3. **Nuclear Matter Parameters**: The analysis of GW170817 has led to tighter constraints on various nuclear matter parameters, such as the pressure and density relationship in neutron star cores. The tidal deformability, which describes how much a neutron star deforms in response to an external gravitational field, was measured from the gravitational wave signal. This measurement is sensitive to the EoS and has implications for the maximum mass of neutron stars and the behavior of nuclear matter at extreme densities.\n\n4. **Neutron Star Masses**: The event confirmed the existence of neutron stars with masses above 2 solar masses, which challenges some theoretical models of neutron star structure and EoS. This has implications for our understanding of the fundamental interactions in nuclear physics and the limits of neutron star stability.\n\n5. **R-Process Nucleosynthesis**: The observations of the kilonova associated with GW170817 provided direct evidence for the r-process as a site for the creation of heavy elements. The light curves and spectra of the kilonova helped to identify the specific nucleosynthetic processes occurring during the merger, linking the astrophysical event to nuclear physics.\n\n6. **Implications for Future Research**: The insights gained from GW170817 have spurred further research into the properties of neutron stars and the behavior of nuclear matter. Ongoing and future gravitational wave detections will continue to refine our understanding of these phenomena, potentially leading to new discoveries in both astrophysics and nuclear physics.\n\nIn summary, GW170817 has significantly advanced our understanding of the EoS of neutron stars, the nature of nuclear matter under extreme conditions, and the processes responsible for the formation of heavy elements in the universe.", "gpt4o_mini_score": 10, "marvel_standard_answer": "\nThe detection of GW170817 provided significant insights into nuclear physics, particularly by constraining the equation of state of nuclear matter and informing about the properties of dense nuclear matter.\n\n\n**Note:** This is a quick response generated by a language model, which may contain inaccuracies. \n                                                    For more detailed answers, please rephrase your question and be sure to request sources and supporting documents.\n                                                    ", "marvel_standard_score": 6, "marvel_deepsearch_answer": "Detection of Gravitational Wave Merger GW170817: Insights into Nuclear Physics\nIntroduction\n\nThe detection of the gravitational wave merger GW170817 has provided significant insights into nuclear physics, particularly in relation to the constraints on nuclear matter parameters.

This groundbreaking event was significant not only because it confirmed the existence of gravitational waves from neutron star mergers but also because it was the first time that such an event was observed across multiple wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum, marking a new era in multi-messenger astronomy.\n\nFollowing the detection of GW170817, a wide range of studies were conducted to analyze the event and its implications. Some key studies and findings related to this event include:\n\n1. **Electromagnetic Counterpart**: The detection of the electromagnetic counterpart, known as **AT2017gfo**, was observed in various wavelengths, including gamma rays, X-rays, optical, and radio. This was a crucial aspect of the event, as it provided insights into the nature of the merger and the processes involved in the formation of heavy elements.\n\n2. **Kilonova Observations**: The event was associated with a kilonova, a transient astronomical event that occurs when two neutron stars merge. Studies focused on the light curve and spectral features of AT2017gfo, which provided evidence for the production of heavy elements like gold and platinum through rapid neutron capture processes (r-process nucleosynthesis).\n\n3. **Gravitational Wave Properties**: The analysis of the gravitational waves emitted during the merger provided important information about the properties of neutron stars, including their masses and the equation of state of nuclear matter at extreme densities.\n\n4. **Cosmological Implications**: GW170817 also had significant implications for cosmology, particularly in measuring the Hubble constant. The distance to the event, determined from the gravitational wave signal, combined with the redshift from the electromagnetic counterpart, allowed for a new measurement of the expansion rate of the universe.\n\n5. **Astrophysical Models**: Numerous studies were conducted to model the merger process, the resulting kilonova, and the associated gamma-ray burst (GRB 170817A). These models helped to understand the dynamics of the merger and the subsequent emissions.\n\nOverall, GW170817 was a landmark event that not only confirmed theoretical predictions about neutron star mergers but also opened up new avenues for research in astrophysics, cosmology, and the study of heavy element formation in the universe.", "gpt4o_mini_score": 9, "marvel_standard_answer": "\nThe significant event associated with the first gravitational-wave detection of a binary neutron star merger is GW170817.

Additionally, there is a focus on distinguishing primordial black holes from astrophysical ones based on their mass and spin, the theoretical frameworks governing their behavior, and the observational evidence and future prospects for detecting primordial black holes. </ANSWER>\n\n# Primordial Black Holes and Their Spin Evolution\n==============================================\n\nPrimordial black holes (PBHs) are predicted to have formed in the early universe through the gravitational collapse of overdense regions during the radiation-dominated epoch. The study of PBHs encompasses various topics, including their theoretical background, observational evidence, and far-reaching implications for understanding the cosmos.\n\n## Formation and Evolution of Primordial Black Holes\n\nThe formation of PBHs is closely related to the conditions in the early universe, including large density fluctuations and an appropriate equation of state. The process can be described by parameters such as $\\delta$ and $\\sigma$, where the probability of forming a PBH relates to the density contrast $\\delta$ through $P(\\delta) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma} e^{-\\frac{\\delta^2}{2\\sigma^2}}$. The mass function of PBHs, which describes their mass distribution, can be derived from the power spectrum of density fluctuations $P(k)$.\n\n## Spin Evolution of Primordial Black Holes\n\nThe spin evolution of PBHs is an important aspect of their study. In standard scenarios, the spin of PBHs is very small at formation. However, the mass and spin can evolve through the cosmic history due to accretion, with the mass and spin being correlated in a redshift-dependent fashion. Specifically, PBHs with masses below $\\mathcal{O}(30)M_{\\odot}$ are likely non-spinning at any redshift, whereas heavier black holes can be nearly extremal up to redshift $z \\sim 10$.\n\n## Observational Evidence and Implications\n\nThe observation of PBHs and their spin evolution has significant implications for understanding the early universe and the formation of black holes.

His work has been cited extensively, with148 research works garnering9767 citations.\n\nImplications of Neutron Star Mergers on Heavy Element Formation in the Universe\n\nNeutron star mergers (NSMs) have emerged as a significant site for heavy element nucleosynthesis in the universe. Research by Rosswog and colleagues has provided crucial insights into the implications of these mergers on our understanding of astrophysical sites of heavy element formation.\n\nNeutron Star Mergers and Nucleosynthesis\n\nStudies have shown that NSMs are a major site for r-process nucleosynthesis, supporting the conclusion that NSMs are likely the dominant site for heavy element formation in the universe [1]. The research implies that these events are significant sites for heavy element formation, with the energy associated with NSMs exceeding150 MeV baryon\n−\n1\n−1\n [2]. Hydrodynamic plus nucleosynthesis calculations indicate that NSMs eject \n≈\n1\n%\n≈1% of a solar mass per event, with extremely neutron-rich ejecta [3].\n\nThe Role of r-Process Nucleosynthesis\n\nThe rapid neutron capture process (r-process) is a key mechanism for creating the heaviest elements. This process involves the rapid capture of neutrons by atomic nuclei, leading to the formation of heavy elements [4]. Rosswog and colleagues' research has investigated the long-term evolution of dynamic ejecta from NSMs for up to100 years, covering a density range of roughly40 orders of magnitude [5].\n\nImplications for Heavy Element Formation\n\nThe implications of Rosswog and colleagues' research on NSMs and nucleosynthesis have significant impacts on our understanding of heavy element formation in the universe. The study suggests that NSMs are responsible for a broad range of r-process nuclei [1]. The research also implies that binary compact mergers are probably a (or the) dominant site of heavy element formation [6].\n\nKilonovae and Heavy Element Formation\n\nKilonovae, quasithermal transients produced in the hours to weeks after merger, are a signature of heavy element nucleosynthesis [7]. Understanding the heavy element yield of these events and mapping when these mergers occurred back through cosmic time requires an extremely sensitive ultraviolet, optical, and infrared telescope that can respond rapidly to external discoveries of NSMs.\n\nMost Cited Publications\n\nThe most cited publications of Rosswog and colleagues in the field of astrophysics from1999 to2017 include:\n\nRosswog et al. (1998): Discussed compact binary mergers as an r-process site.\nFreiburghaus et al.

(2014): Investigated the electromagnetic signatures of neutron-star mergers.\nRosswog et al. (2017): Presented a study on the kilonova associated with GW170817/GRB170817A.\n\nThe key findings of these publications include:\n\nThe merger of two neutron stars is a major site of r-process nucleosynthesis.\nThe dynamical ejecta from the merger of two neutron stars produces the heaviest elements, including lanthanides and actinides.\nThe kilonova associated with GW170817/GRB170817A was powered by the radioactive decay of massive neutron-rich nuclides created via r-process nucleosynthesis.\nAdditional Contributions\n\nRosswog and colleagues have also made significant contributions to the development of new methods for simulating astrophysical phenomena, including the implementation of magnetic fields into SPH and the development of the Lagrangian hydrodynamics code MAGMA2.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, Stephan Rosswog and his colleagues have made significant contributions to the field of astrophysics, particularly in the areas of compact objects, neutron star mergers, and heavy element formation.

However, it also changes the length scale, with the Fresnel length \\( r_f \\) being proportional to \\( \\sqrt{d_l} \\), which dictates the radial distance of the solar profile probed and the corresponding frequency \\( f \\). Thus, missions farther in the outer solar system may provide better probing of the inner and outer parts of the Sun.", "gpt4o_mini_answer": "In the context of solar system missions, changing the distance \\( d_l \\) (which typically refers to the distance to a lensing object, such as a planet or a star) can have significant implications for gravitational lensing effects and the event rate of such phenomena. Here are some key points to consider:\n\n### 1. **Gravitational Lensing Basics**\nGravitational lensing occurs when a massive object (the lens) distorts the light from a more distant source due to its gravitational field. The degree of lensing depends on several factors, including the mass of the lensing object, the distance to the lens, and the distance to the source.\n\n### 2. **Impact of Changing \\( d_l \\)**\n- **Lensing Geometry**: The geometry of the lensing effect is influenced by the distances involved. If \\( d_l \\) increases, the alignment between the source, lens, and observer becomes less critical, which can reduce the strength of the lensing effect.\n  \n- **Einstein Ring Radius**: The Einstein ring radius, which characterizes the size of the lensed image, is given by:\n  \\[\n  \\theta_E = \\sqrt{\\frac{4GM}{c^2} \\frac{d_{ls}}{d_l d_s}}\n  \\]\n  where \\( d_{ls} \\) is the distance between the lens and the source, \\( d_s \\) is the distance to the source, and \\( M \\) is the mass of the lens. As \\( d_l \\) increases, the Einstein ring radius decreases, leading to smaller and potentially less detectable lensed images.\n\n### 3. **Event Rate Considerations**\n- **Increased Distance**: As \\( d_l \\) increases, the event rate of observable lensing events may decrease. This is because the probability of alignment between the lens and the source diminishes with distance, reducing the likelihood of observing significant lensing effects.\n\n- **Volume of Space**: Conversely, increasing \\( d_l \\) can also mean exploring a larger volume of space, which might increase the number of potential lensing events if there are more lensing objects available. However, the effective rate of observable events may still be lower due to the reasons mentioned above.\n\n### 4. **Observational Challenges**\n- **Sensitivity**: The sensitivity of instruments to detect lensed images can be affected by distance. As \\( d_l \\) increases, the light from the source may be fainter, making it harder to detect lensed images.\n\n- **Background Noise**: At greater distances, the background noise from the universe can also increase, complicating the detection of subtle lensing effects.\n\n### 5. **Applications in Missions**\nIn solar system missions, understanding the implications of changing \\( d_l \\) is crucial for mission planning, especially if the goal is to study gravitational lensing for astrophysical research or to search for exoplanets. Adjustments in distance can affect the design of instruments, the selection of targets, and the overall mission objectives.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn summary, changing the distance \\( d_l \\) in solar system missions can significantly impact the gravitational lensing effect and the event rate of observable lensing phenomena. While increasing \\( d_l \\) may allow for the exploration of a larger volume of space, it can also lead to weaker lensing effects and lower event rates due to geometric and observational challenges.

According to a study, for the majority of events, the peak flux decreases with increasing radial distance [1]. The lensing effect is affected by the distance from the Sun's focal point, which is at least \n550\n550 AU away [2]. The size of the image on the focal plane is proportional to the focal length of the telescope, and the amplification of the signal from an Earth-diameter planet at \n10\n10 LY distance is by a factor of \n6400\n6400 [1]. The resolving power of the solar lens is crucial in understanding the implications of changing the distance \n𝑑\n𝑙\nd\nl\n\t​\n\n. The change in distance \n𝑑\n𝑙\nd\nl\n\t​\n\n affects the peak flux and event rate for solar system missions through its impact on the density of cosmic ions, given by l(r, R) = l_0(R) \\exp \\left\\{ -\\int_{r_0}^{r} \\frac{V(r')dr'}{D(r', R)} \\right\\}, where \n𝑙\n(\n𝑟\n,\n𝑅\n)\nl(r,R) is the ion density at radial distance \n𝑟\nr and magnetic rigidity \n𝑅\nR, \n𝑉\n(\n𝑟\n′\n)\nV(r\n′\n) is the wind speed, and \n𝐷\n(\n𝑟\n′\n,\n𝑅\n)\nD(r\n′\n,R) is the diffusion coefficient [3]. The solar radiation energy incident on a satellite surface varies as a function of the distance from the Sun, following the inverse-square law, which can be expressed as \n𝐸\n∝\nE∝\\frac{1}{d^2}\n,\n, where \n𝐸\nE is the energy flux and \n𝑑\nd is the distance from the Sun [4]. Additionally, the lens increases the intensity of light from the exoplanet by a factor of \n100\n,\n000\n100,000, but this advantage can only be realized if the exoplanet light can be well separated from the light from other sources. The diffraction-limited resolution of the gravitational lens has been the subject of several previous analyses, and it is limited by factors other than diffraction. Furthermore, the mission could only have a single objective, and to point at a different object just \n1\n1 degree away, the telescope would have to move at least \n10\n10 AU around the sun. The focal blur due to spherical aberration is a blur with a characteristic width of exactly half the diameter of the planet imaged, regardless of the distance or the size of the focal plane. The event rate and peak flux at high radial distances are also affected, as particles can be accelerated at forward and reverse shock pairs that develop along the leading edges of slow solar wind events, typically forming at heliospheric distances beyond \n1\n1 AU [5].

Regions with high detection probability for habitable planets include constellations like Centaurus and Sagittarius, and the Galactic Bulge. The gravitational lensing effect of the Sun plays a crucial role in the detection of exoplanets, and understanding the resolving power of the solar lens is essential in designing solar system missions.

The specific mission design implications of changing the distance \n𝑑\n𝑙\nd\nl\n\t​\n\n on the detection of exoplanets using the solar gravitational lens include the field of view and magnification, orbital mechanics, mission architecture, traversal time and navigation, and imaging and spectroscopy. For instance, as \n𝑑\n𝑙\nd\nl\n\t​\n\n increases beyond \n550\n550 AU, the field of view contracts with a corresponding increase in magnification, but at a less steep rate than when entering \"the zone\". Significant radial motions are required for a slewing maneuver to detect an Earth-like exoplanet around a Sol-like star. A two-stage laser sail could facilitate the mission, with one sail for transit and a smaller one for insertion into an orbit around a \n550\n550 AU minor planet, allowing for adjustable scanning. Increasing \n𝑑\n𝑙\nd\nl\n\t​\n\n also implies longer traversal times to reach the desired location, and navigation during the mission phase is considered challenging. The SGL's properties, including the effect of \n𝑑\n𝑙\nd\nl\n\t​\n\n on detection, are crucial for producing high-resolution, multipixel images and spectroscopy of exoplanets. Furthermore, a mission architecture for the solar gravity lens has been proposed, which includes a detailed design for the spacecraft and its trajectory [@\"url:https://www.centauri-dreams.org/2023/02/08/a-mission-architecture-for-the-solar-gravity-lens/\"]. The solar gravity lens can also be used to look for exoplanets, as demonstrated by recent studies [@\"url:https://aerospace.org/article/solar-gravity-lens-looks-exoplanets\"]. Additionally, direct multipixel imaging and spectroscopy of an exoplanet with a solar gravity lens mission have been explored in detail [@\"url:https://www.researchgate.net/publication/339550939_Direct_Multipixel_Imaging_and_Spectroscopy_of_an_Exoplanet_with_a_Solar_Gravity_Lens_Mission.pdf\"]. These studies provide valuable insights into the implications of changing the distance \n𝑑\n𝑙\nd\nl\n\t​\n\n on the lensing effect and event rate, and demonstrate the potential of the solar gravity lens for detecting exoplanets. The minimal distance to the focus of the Sun's gravitational lens is about \n550\n550 AU, approximately \n82\n82 billion kilometers. The Sun continues to act as a lens beyond this minimum; at longer distances, the focused light passes increasingly far from the solar limb. The size of the image on the focal plane is proportional to the focal length of the telescope, and the amplification of the signal from an Earth-diameter planet at \n10\n10 LY distance is by a factor of \n6400\n6400 [1]. The resolving power of the solar lens is crucial in understanding the implications of changing the distance \n𝑑\n𝑙\nd\nl\n\t​\n\n. According to Geoffrey Landis' work at NASA's John Glenn Research Center in Cleveland, the basic physics is straightforward and has been worked out in some detail by astronomers in the past, with general relativity predicting that light must bend around any massive object. The sun's focal point is at least \n550\n550 astronomical units (AU) away, and to ensure that the Einstein ring is larger than the corona and not obscured by it, the mission would have to sit even further, at a distance of more than \n2\n,\n000\n2,000 AU [2]. The implications of changing the distance \n𝑑\n𝑙\nd\nl\n\t​\n\n in solar system missions on the lensing effect and event rate are such that, according to a study, for the majority of events, the peak flux decreases with increasing radial distance. No clear radial dependence was observed for the first-order anisotropy and the rise time [3]. The lens increases the intensity of light from the exoplanet by a factor of \n100\n,\n000\n100,000, but this advantage can only be realized if the exoplanet light can be well separated from the light from other sources. The mission could only have a single objective, and to point at a different object just \n1\n1 degree away, the telescope would have to move at least \n10\n10 AU around the sun.

The change in distance \n𝑑\n𝑙\nd\nl\n\t​\n\n affects the peak flux and event rate for solar system missions, particularly for events with high radial distances. Scaling laws for the changes of average field magnitude, event counts, and SFR scale sizes with respect to radial distances have been derived, covering a range from \n∼\n∼0.3 au for Helios to \n∼\n∼7 au for the Voyager spacecraft. The solar radiation energy incident on a satellite surface varies as a function of the distance from the Sun, following the inverse-square law. The change in distance \n𝑑\n𝑙\nd\nl\n\t​\n\n also affects the peak flux and event rate for solar system missions, particularly for events with high radial distances, as particles can be accelerated at forward and reverse shock pairs that develop along the leading edges of slow solar wind events, typically forming at heliospheric distances beyond1 AU.

Additionally, the lensing effect is affected by the distance from the Sun's focal point, which is at least \n550\n550 AU away, as mentioned in Document3. Understanding these relationships is crucial for predicting and analyzing space weather events. The distance \n𝑑\n𝑙\nd\nl\n\t​\n\n to the lens affects the Einstein ring size, with a larger \n𝑑\n𝑙\nd\nl\n\t​\n\n resulting in a larger linear Einstein radius \n𝑅\n𝐸\nR\nE\n\t​\n\n.

However, under a realistic PNG model, the maximum compactness shrinks.", "gpt4o_mini_answer": "To analyze the maximum compactness of a spherically symmetric stable boson star with a $|\\phi|^4$ interaction, we first need to understand the properties of such stars. Boson stars are solutions to the Einstein-Klein-Gordon equations, where the scalar field $\\phi$ has a potential that includes a quartic term, typically of the form $V(\\phi) = \\frac{\\lambda}{4} |\\phi|^4$.\n\nThe compactness of a star is defined as the ratio of its mass $M$ to its radius $R$, given by \\( C = \\frac{M}{R} \\). For boson stars, the maximum compactness can be derived from the balance between gravitational binding and the pressure due to the scalar field.\n\nIn the case of a boson star with a $|\\phi|^4$ interaction, it has been found that the maximum compactness can reach values close to that of a black hole, specifically around \\( C \\approx 0.5 \\). This is in contrast to ordinary stars, which have a maximum compactness of about \\( C \\approx 0.2 - 0.25 \\).\n\nWhen considering a realistic model of the scalar field, such as a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone (PNG) boson model, the dynamics and interactions of the scalar field can change significantly. PNG bosons arise in theories with spontaneous symmetry breaking and can have different mass scales and interaction strengths compared to the simple quartic potential.\n\nIn a PNG model, the effective potential may be modified, and the stability conditions for the boson star can also change. Depending on the specific parameters of the PNG model, the maximum compactness could either increase or decrease. However, it is generally expected that the compactness will still be bounded by the properties of the underlying gravitational theory and the nature of the scalar field.\n\nIn summary, for a spherically symmetric stable boson star with a $|\\phi|^4$ interaction, the maximum compactness is approximately \\( C \\approx 0.5 \\). Under a realistic PNG model, the compactness may vary, but it is typically expected to remain in a similar range, potentially influenced by the specific characteristics of the PNG boson interactions.

In many contexts, particularly in control theory and signal processing, \\(\\alpha\\) can be associated with the degree of smoothness or regularity of the system's response or the input signals.\n\n### Significance of the Smoothness Parameter \\(\\alpha\\)\n\n1. **System Dynamics**: The parameter \\(\\alpha\\) often influences the dynamics of the system. For instance, in a state-space representation, it can affect the rates of change of state variables, the response to inputs, and the overall behavior of the system over time.\n\n2. **Regularization**: In some applications, \\(\\alpha\\) serves as a regularization parameter that helps to control the trade-off between fitting the data and maintaining a smooth solution. A larger \\(\\alpha\\) may lead to smoother trajectories, while a smaller \\(\\alpha\\) may allow for more variability and responsiveness to changes.\n\n3. **Model Complexity**: The choice of \\(\\alpha\\) can also dictate the complexity of the model. A very smooth model (high \\(\\alpha\\)) may underfit the data, while a less smooth model (low \\(\\alpha\\)) may overfit. Thus, selecting an appropriate \\(\\alpha\\) is essential for achieving a balance between bias and variance.\n\n### Relation to Stability\n\n1. **Stability Criteria**: The stability of a state-space system is often determined by the eigenvalues of the system matrix (or matrices). The smoothness parameter \\(\\alpha\\) can influence these eigenvalues. For example, if \\(\\alpha\\) affects the damping characteristics of the system, it can lead to either stable or unstable behavior depending on its value.\n\n2. **Damping and Oscillations**: A higher smoothness parameter may introduce more damping into the system, which can help in stabilizing oscillatory modes. Conversely, a lower \\(\\alpha\\) might lead to less damping, potentially resulting in oscillations or instability.\n\n3. **Response to Perturbations**: The smoothness parameter can also affect how the system responds to perturbations. A system with a well-chosen \\(\\alpha\\) will typically return to equilibrium more quickly and smoothly after a disturbance, indicating better stability.\n\n4. **Lyapunov Stability**: In some cases, the smoothness parameter can be related to Lyapunov stability criteria, where the smoothness of the state trajectories can ensure that the system remains bounded and converges to a desired equilibrium point.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, the smoothness parameter \\(\\alpha\\) is significant in shaping the dynamics, complexity, and stability of a state-space model.

A high value of \n𝛼\nα allows rapid changes, while a low value leads to smooth changes. The significance of \n𝛼\nα can be understood through various lenses, including \n𝛼\nα-stability, linear stability, and numerical analysis. In the context of Simple Exponential Smoothing (SES), the smoothing parameter \n𝛼\n^\nα\n^\n regulates how much the model reacts to the previous forecast error, with a value close to zero giving more weight to the previous fitted value and a value close to one assigning more weight to the actual value https://openforecast.org/adam/SES.html. The smoothness parameter \n𝛼\nα determines whether the dynamics of the system are discontinuous or smooth, with discontinuous dynamics appearing when \n𝛼\n=\n0\nα=0 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378437120302284. The \n𝛼\nα-slope of a coherent system \n(\n𝐸\n,\n𝑉\n)\n(E,V) is defined as \n𝜇\n𝛼\n(\n𝐸\n,\n𝑉\n)\n:\n=\ndeg\n⁡\n𝐸\n+\n𝛼\n⋅\ndim\n⁡\n𝑉\nr\nk\n \n𝐸\nμ\nα\n\t​\n\n(E,V):=\nrkE\ndegE+α⋅dimV\n\t​\n\n, with the system being \n𝛼\nα-semistable if \n𝜇\n𝛼\n(\n𝐹\n,\n𝑊\n)\n≤\n𝜇\n𝛼\n(\n𝐸\n,\n𝑉\n)\nμ\nα\n\t​\n\n(F,W)≤μ\nα\n\t​\n\n(E,V) for all proper coherent subsystems \n(\n𝐹\n,\n𝑊\n)\n(F,W), and \n𝛼\nα-stable if the inequality is strict https://arxiv.org/html/2409.12794v1. Furthermore, the smoothness parameter \n𝛼\nα influences the estimation and forecasting performance through SimulationSmoother and KalmanSmoother classes in state-space models https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/statespace.html, with a new stability measure, namely, the smoothed spectral abscissa \n𝛼\n~\n𝜖\n(\n𝐴\n)\nα\n~\nϵ\n\t​\n\n(A), based on the inversion of a relaxed \n𝐻\n2\nH\n2\n\t​\n\n-type cost https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220133188_The_Smoothed_Spectral_Abscissa_for_Robust_Stability_Optimization. The smoothness parameter \n𝛼\nα affects the trade-off between stability and responsiveness in state-space models by regulating the decay rate of impulse responses and determining model dimensionality, with a higher \n𝛼\nα value suggesting a slower decay of impulse responses and potentially increasing responsiveness but possibly at the cost of reduced stability https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10161125/. The choice of \n𝛼\nα is crucial for balancing responsiveness and stability, often determined through techniques like cross-validation or grid search. The smoothness parameter \n𝛼\nα governs the amount of change in successive levels of the state-space model, with high values of \n𝛼\nα allowing for rapid changes, leading to a “rougher” estimate of the level, while low values of \n𝛼\nα result in smooth changes and a “smoother” level. The parameter \n𝛼\nα controls the trade-off between adapting to changes and filtering out noise, with values closer to \n1\n1 leading to a random walk model and values closer to \n0\n0 resulting in no change over time. The error correction form of Simple Exponential Smoothing (SES) is given by \n𝑦\n^\n𝑡\n+\n1\n=\n𝑦\n^\n𝑡\n+\n𝛼\n^\n𝑒\n𝑡\ny\n^\n\t​\n\nt+1\n\t​\n\n=\ny\n^\n\t​\n\nt\n\t​\n\n+\nα\n^\ne\nt\n\t​\n\n, where \n𝛼\n^\nα\n^\n regulates how much the model reacts to the previous forecast error https://openforecast.org/adam/SES.html. The state equation shows the evolution of the state through time, with the influence of the smoothing parameter \n𝛼\nα governing the amount of change in successive levels, and the equations of the model can be written as \n𝑦\n𝑡\n=\nℓ\n𝑡\n−\n1\n+\n𝜀\n𝑡\ny\nt\n\t​\n\n=ℓ\nt−1\n\t​\n\n+ε\nt\n\t​\n\n and \nℓ\n𝑡\n=\nℓ\n𝑡\n−\n1\n+\n𝛼\n𝜀\n𝑡\nℓ\nt\n\t​\n\n=ℓ\nt−1\n\t​\n\n+αε\nt\n\t​\n\n, which constitute an innovations state space model underlying simple exponential smoothing https://otexts.com/fpp3/ets.html. The smoothness parameter \n𝛼\nα plays a vital role in determining a system's robustness to outliers and its ability to handle non-stationarity in the data. According to https://merit.url.edu/files/42870101/Dual_Sourcing_and_Smoothing_under_Non-Stationary_Demand.pdf, the implications of \n𝛼\nα on the system's robustness and ability to handle non-stationarity can be understood by analyzing its effect on local order variance. The adjustment of \n𝛼\nα in the \n𝛼\nα-trimming filter relies on prior knowledge about the proportion of data points that deviate from the nominal distribution https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2024/file/f21a76d688be0553c943a6b6c1d4bb1f-Paper-Conference.pdf. The tuning of \n𝛼\nα impacts the sensitivity of estimators and efficiency at the nominal density. Additionally, the smoothness parameter \n𝛼\nα has been investigated in the context of robust stability analysis for linear time-invariant systems subject to perturbations of parameters that vary smoothly in time https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224700015_Robust_Stability_Analysis_against_Perturbations_of_Smoothly_Time-Varying_Parameters. The significance of \n𝛼\nα has also been explored in the context of alpha uncertainty and disturbance-based robust controller for trajectory tracking of octocopter UAV https://www.researchgate.net/publication/375170214_Alpha_Uncertainty_and_Disturbance_Based_Robust_Controller_for_Trajectory_Tracking_of_Octocopter_UAV. In conclusion, the smoothness parameter \n𝛼\nα plays a vital role in state-space models, influencing the stability and dynamics of the system, and its significance can be understood through various lenses, including \n𝛼\nα-stability, linear stability, and numerical analysis, with the choice of \n𝛼\nα having a substantial impact on the performance of the model https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_beta_filter, https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/exponential-smoothing, https://www.bauer.uh.edu/gardner/exponential-smoothing.pdf. </TASK_OUTPUT>\n\nSUMMARY\n\n<TASK_OUTPUT> The smoothness parameter \n𝛼\nα plays a crucial role in state-space models, influencing the stability and dynamics of the system. This parameter determines the amount of change in successive levels, with high values allowing rapid changes and low values leading to smooth changes.\n\nInfluence on System Stability\n\nThe smoothness parameter \n𝛼\nα influences the estimation and forecasting performance through SimulationSmoother and KalmanSmoother classes in state-space models [https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/statespace.html]. A new stability measure, namely, the smoothed spectral abscissa \n𝛼\n~\n𝜖\n(\n𝐴\n)\nα\n~\nϵ\n\t​\n\n(A), is based on the inversion of a relaxed \n𝐻\n2\nH\n2\n\t​\n\n-type cost [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220133188_The_Smoothed_Spectral_Abscissa_for_Robust_Stability_Optimization].\n\nTrade-off between Stability and Responsiveness\n\nThe smoothness parameter \n𝛼\nα affects the trade-off between stability and responsiveness in state-space models by regulating the decay rate of impulse responses and determining model dimensionality. A higher \n𝛼\nα value (closer to 1) suggests a slower decay of impulse responses, potentially increasing responsiveness but possibly at the cost of reduced stability. The stability of the system is ensured by \n𝛼\nα influencing the Hurwitz nature of the system's coefficients, indicating stability with negative real part eigenvalues [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10161125/].\n\nImpact on Adaptability and Stability\n\nThe smoothness parameter \n𝛼\nα impacts the system's ability to adapt to sudden changes versus maintaining stability over time by controlling the weight given to recent versus past observations. A higher value of \n𝛼\nα (closer to 1) allows for quicker adaptation to sudden changes but may reduce stability, while a lower value of \n𝛼\nα (closer to 0) results in a smoother but slower adaptation to changes [https://otexts.com/fpp2/ets.html].\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the smoothness parameter \n𝛼\nα plays a vital role in state-space models, influencing the stability and dynamics of the system. Its significance can be understood through various lenses, including \n𝛼\nα-stability, linear stability, and numerical analysis. The choice of \n𝛼\nα has a substantial impact on the performance of the model, and its optimal value depends on the specific application and system being modeled.\n\nReferences\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378437120302284\nhttps://openforecast.org/adam/SES.html\nhttps://arxiv.org/html/2409.12794v1\nhttps://otexts.com/fpp3/ets.html\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0011227507000045\nhttps://www.statsmodels.org/stable/statespace.html\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/220133188_The_Smoothed_Spectral_Abscissa_for_Robust_Stability_Optimization\nhttps://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10161125/\nhttps://otexts.com/fpp2/ets.html\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/375170214_Alpha_Uncertainty_and_Disturbance_Based_Robust_Controller_for_Trajectory_Tracking_of_Octocopter_UAV </TASK_OUTPUT>\nREFERENCES\n\n<TASK_OUTPUT>\n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378437120302284\nhttps://openforecast.org/adam/SES.html\nhttps://arxiv.org/html/2409.12794v1\nhttps://otexts.com/fpp3/ets.html\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0011227507000045\nhttps://www.statsmodels.org/stable/statespace.html\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/220133188_The_Smoothed_Spectral_Abscissa_for_Robust_Stability_Optimization\nhttps://fastercapital.com/topics/exponential-smoothing-forecasting-formula.html\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_beta_filter\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/exponential-smoothing\nhttps://fastercapital.com/topics/understanding-exponential-smoothing.html\nhttps://brainly.com/question/49383540\nhttps://www.cliffsnotes.com/study-notes/22849607\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/figure/Effect-of-a-value-on-accuracy-and-smoothness-of-the-regularized-Dirac-delta-function_fig1_275833629\nhttp://sontaglab.org/FTPDIR/04cetraro.pdf\nhttps://users.ox.ac.uk/~mast0315/STES.pdf\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/exponential-smoothing\nhttps://www.bauer.uh.edu/gardner/exponential-smoothing.pdf\nhttps://merit.url.edu/files/42870101/Dual_Sourcing_and_Smoothing_under_Non-Stationary_Demand.pdf\nhttps://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2024/file/f21a76d688be0553c943a6b6c1d4bb1f-Paper-Conference.pdf\nhttps://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40092-014-0075-5\nhttps://arxiv.org/html/2307.02163v2\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/350520468_Robust_smoothing_of_one-dimensional_data_with_missing_andor_outlier_values\nhttps://arxiv.org/html/2411.04034v1\nhttps://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10161125\nhttps://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2008.04733.pdf\nhttps://robjhyndman.com/expsmooth\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/375170214_Alpha_Uncertainty_and_Disturbance_Based_Robust_Controller_for_Trajectory_Tracking_of_Octocopter_UAV\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/224700015_Robust_Stability_Analysis_against_Perturbations_of_Smoothly_Time-Varying_Parameters </TASK_OUTPUT>", "marvel_deepsearch_score": 8, "evaluation_model_type": "openai", "evaluation_model_name": "gpt-4o-mini", "qa_model_type": "openai", "qa_model_name": "gpt-4o-mini", "gpt4o_mini_answer_relevancy": 0.95, "gpt4o_mini_answer_correctness": 0.8, "gpt4o_mini_faithfulness": 0.85, "marvel_standard_answer_relevancy": 0.85, "marvel_standard_answer_correctness": 0.7, "marvel_standard_faithfulness": 0.8, "marvel_deepsearch_answer_relevancy": 0.92, "marvel_deepsearch_answer_correctness": 0.9, "marvel_deepsearch_faithfulness": 0.78}

It involves vector components, operations like summation or integration, and satisfies properties such as linearity, symmetry, and positive definiteness. </ANSWER>\n\n# Inner Product: Mathematical Expressions and Properties\nThe inner product is a mathematical operation that extends the dot product concept to abstract vector spaces, often involving complex numbers. It can be expressed as $\\langle x, y \\rangle$ or $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \\overline{y_i}$ for vectors $x = (x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)$ and $y = (y_1, y_2, ..., y_n)$ in a complex vector space.\n\n## Definition and Properties\nThe inner product $\\langle, \\rangle$ is defined by the axioms:\n1. $\\langle x, x \\rangle \\neq 0$ whenever $x \\neq 0$;\n2. $x \\mapsto \\langle x, y \\rangle$ is linear for each $y \\in E$;\n3. $|\\langle x, y \\rangle|^2 \\leq \\langle x, x \\rangle \\langle y, y \\rangle$.\n\nIn a real vector space, the inner product satisfies the following four properties:\n1. $\\langle u + v, w \\rangle = \\langle u, w \\rangle + \\langle v, w \\rangle$\n2. $\\langle \\alpha v, w \\rangle = \\alpha \\langle v, w \\rangle$\n3. $\\langle v, w \\rangle = \\langle w, v \\rangle$\n4. $\\langle v, v \\rangle > 0$ and equal to $0$ if and only if $v = 0$.\n\n## Mathematical Expressions\nThe mathematical expression for the inner product defined in the context involves:\n* $\\langle x, y \\rangle := \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i y_i$, where $x = (x_1, ..., x_n)$ and $y = (y_1, ..., y_n)$ are vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^n$.\n* $\\langle \\vec{u}, \\vec{v} \\rangle = \\vec{u}^T \\vec{v}$ for real vectors and $\\langle \\vec{u}, \\vec{v} \\rangle = \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i \\bar{b_i}$ for complex vectors.\n* $\\langle f, g \\rangle = \\int_{a}^{b} f(x)g(x) dx$ for functions in $C([a, b])$.\n* $\\langle X, Y \\rangle = \\mathbb{E}[XY]$ for real random variables $X$ and $Y$.\n\n## Examples and Variations\nThe inner product can be represented in different forms, such as:\n* $\\langle x, y \\rangle = 2x_1y_1 -

In fluid dynamics, dissipation is associated with the conversion of kinetic energy into thermal energy due to friction and turbulence.\n\n2. **\\( \\langle t \\frac{ds}{dt} \\rangle \\)**: This expression indicates the average rate of change of entropy (\\( s \\)) with respect to time (\\( t \\)). The factor \\( t \\) suggests that the dissipation is being considered over a time scale, which is important in dynamic systems where entropy production can vary with time.\n\n3. **Integral Term \\( \\langle \\int \\frac{\\kappa}{t} (\\nabla \\delta t)^2 d^3r \\rangle \\)**: \n   - **\\( \\kappa \\)**: This typically represents a thermal conductivity or a similar coefficient that quantifies how easily heat is conducted through a medium.\n   - **\\( \\nabla \\delta t \\)**: This term represents the spatial gradient of a temperature fluctuation (\\( \\delta t \\)). The gradient indicates how temperature changes in space, which is crucial for understanding heat transfer and dissipation.\n   - **\\( d^3r \\)**: This indicates integration over a three-dimensional volume, suggesting that the dissipation is being considered throughout a spatial domain.\n\nOverall, this equation encapsulates the idea that the dissipation of energy (or entropy production) in a system can be quantified by examining the spatial variations in temperature and how these variations contribute to the overall energy loss in the form of heat. The average over the volume and time indicates that this is a statistical or ensemble average, which is common in thermodynamic analyses of complex systems.\n\nIn summary, this equation is a mathematical representation of how energy dissipation occurs in a system due to thermal gradients and is particularly relevant in the study of non-equilibrium thermodynamics and fluid dynamics.", "gpt4o_mini_score": 9, "marvel_standard_answer": "... \n\n$w_{diss}$ represents the average rate of energy dissipation in a system, related to entropy production.\n\n\n**Note:** This is a quick response generated by a language model, which may contain inaccuracies. \n                                                    For more detailed answers, please rephrase your question and be sure to request sources and supporting documents.\n                                                    ", "marvel_standard_score": 3, "marvel_deepsearch_answer": "KEY_FACTS\n\n<TASK_OUTPUT>\n\nThe equation \n𝑤\n𝑑\n𝑖\n𝑠\n𝑠\n=\n⟨\n𝑡\n(\n𝑑\n𝑠\n/\n𝑑\n𝑡\n)\n⟩\n=\n⟨\n∫\n(\n𝜅\n/\n𝑡\n)\n(\n∇\n𝛿\n𝑡\n)\n2\n𝑑\n3\n𝑟\n⟩\nw\ndiss\n\t​\n\n=⟨t(ds/dt)⟩=⟨∫(κ/t)(∇δt)\n2\nd\n3\nr⟩ represents the dissipation rate of a scalar field in the context of turbulent flows or magnetohydrodynamics.\nIt quantifies the rate at which energy is being dissipated due to the diffusion of a scalar quantity, such as temperature or a passive scalar, in a fluid.\n𝑤\n𝑑\n𝑖\n𝑠\n𝑠\nw\ndiss\n\t​\n\n is the dissipation rate, \n𝑡\nt is time, \n𝑠\ns is the scalar field, \n𝜅\nκ is the diffusion coefficient of the scalar, and \n∇\n𝛿\n𝑡\n∇δt represents the gradient of fluctuations in the scalar field.\nThe term \n⟨\n𝑡\n(\n𝑑\n𝑠\n/\n𝑑\n𝑡\n)\n⟩\n⟨t(ds/dt)⟩ suggests a time-averaged rate of change of the scalar field, which is related to how quickly the scalar field is being dissipated.\nThe term \n⟨\n∫\n(\n𝜅\n/\n𝑡\n)\n(\n∇\n𝛿\n𝑡\n)\n2\n𝑑\n3\n𝑟\n⟩\n⟨∫(κ/t)(∇δt)\n2\nd\n3\nr⟩ provides a detailed view of the dissipation process by integrating over the entire volume and averaging over different realizations or spatial locations.\nThe dissipation rate \n𝑤\n𝑑\n𝑖\n𝑠\n𝑠\nw\ndiss\n\t​\n\n is crucial in understanding various physical processes, including mixing, heat transfer, and the behavior of magnetic fields in conductive fluids.\nIt helps in characterizing the efficiency of scalar diffusion and dissipation in different systems. </TASK_OUTPUT>\nFINER_DETAILS\n\n<TASK_OUTPUT> The equation \n𝑤\n𝑑\n𝑖\n𝑠\n𝑠\n=\n⟨\n𝑡\n(\n𝑑\n𝑠\n/\n𝑑\n𝑡\n)\n⟩\n=\n⟨\n∫\n(\n𝜅\n/\n𝑡\n)\n(\n∇\n𝛿\n𝑡\n)\n2\n𝑑\n3\n𝑟\n⟩\nw\ndiss\n\t​\n\n=⟨t(ds/dt)⟩=⟨∫(κ/t)(∇δt)\n2\nd\n3\nr⟩ represents the dissipation rate of a scalar field, often in the context of turbulent flows or magnetohydrodynamics.

The specific rates can vary based on the population models used, but the results indicated that the merger rates for these lighter systems are not as high as those for more massive binaries.\n\n2. **Sensitivity Limits**: The sensitivity of LIGO during O1 was primarily optimized for detecting higher mass systems.

The most significant trigger has a false alarm rate of \n0.14\ny\nr\n−\n1\n0.14yr\n−1\n, implying an upper limit on the merger rate of subsolar binaries in the range \n220\n–\n24200\nG\np\nc\n−\n3\n \ny\nr\n−\n1\n220–24200Gpc\n−3\nyr\n−1\n, depending on the chirp mass of the binary [2,4]. The non-detection of a stochastic background yields constraints that are about a factor of two weaker than the targeted search [3]. The upper limits on the merger rate imply that PBHs could comprise a fraction or all of the unknown dark matter in the universe, but the exact fraction is limited by the merger rate. For example, the population of merging \n0.2\n𝑀\n⊙\n0.2M\n⊙\n\t​\n\n black holes is constrained to account for less than \n16\n%\n16% of the dark matter density, and a population of merging \n1.0\n𝑀\n⊙\n1.0M\n⊙\n\t​\n\n black holes to account for less than \n2\n%\n2% of the dark matter density. The search for sub-solar mass ultracompact binaries using data from LIGO's first observing run has provided the tightest constraints to date on the merger rate and abundance of sub-solar mass ultracompact binaries. The results have significant implications for our understanding of the properties of dark matter and the potential existence of primordial black holes. </TASK_OUTPUT>\n\nREFERENCES\n\n<TASK_OUTPUT>\n\narXiv:2109.12197\nLIGO-P2100163-v8\nLIGO-P1800158\nPhys.

This article discusses the improvements made in the detection threshold and sensitivity of search methods compared to previous searches.\n\n### Application of Hough Search for Continuous Gravitational Waves\n\nThe application of a Hough search for continuous gravitational waves on data from the 5th LIGO science run has been reported[^1]. This search covered the frequency range $50-1000$ Hz with the first derivative of frequency in the range $-8.9 \\cdot10^{-10}$ Hz/s to zero. The search employed a Hough transform technique, introducing a $\\chi^2$ test and analysis of coincidences between signal levels in years 1 and 2 of observations. This approach offered a significant improvement in the product of strain sensitivity with compute cycles per data sample compared to previously published searches.\n\n### All-Sky Search for Periodic Gravitational Waves\n\nAn all-sky search for periodic gravitational waves in the early fifth-science-run data was reported in LIGO-P080024-x0[^2]. This search utilized data from the first eight months of the fifth LIGO science run (S5) and was based on a semicoherent method (PowerFlux) of summing strain power. The search covered a frequency range of $50-1100$ Hz and a frequency's time derivative range of $-5 \\times10^{-9} -0$ Hz s$^{-1}$. The $95\\%$ confidence-level upper limits on radiation emitted by any unknown isolated rotating neutron stars within the search range were reported, with strain limits below $10^{-24}$ obtained over a $200$-Hz band.\n\n### Comparison with Previous HMM Search\n\nHowever, a direct comparison with the previous HMM search described in reference 2017lschmm is not straightforward, as the provided text chunks do not contain information about detection threshold, sensitivity, search method, and the previous HMM search described in reference 2017lschmm.\n\n### Novelty Detection and Threshold Selection\n\nA new method for automatically selecting thresholds utilizing a linear search and leave-one-out cross-validation on the ID classes has been proposed[^3]. This approach is presented in the publication \"Continual Improvement of Threshold-Based Novelty Detection\" available at <https://www.researchgate.net/publication/373715154_Continual_Improvement_of_Threshold-Based_Novelty_Detection>.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, recent searches have shown significant improvements in detection threshold and sensitivity. The Hough search and all-sky search for periodic gravitational waves have demonstrated improved strain sensitivity and increased spatial volume sampled. However, a direct comparison with the previous HMM search is not possible with the provided information.\n\n### References\n\n[^1]: [Application of a Hough search for continuous gravitational waves on data from the 5th LIGO science run](https://dcc.ligo.org/LIGO-P1300071/public)\n[^2]: [All Sky LIGO Search for Periodic Gravitational Waves in the Early Fifth Science Run Data](https://dcc.ligo.org/LIGO-P080024/public)\n[^3]: [Continual Improvement of Threshold-Based Novelty Detection](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/373715154_Continual_Improvement_of_Threshold-Based_Novelty_Detection)", "marvel_standard_score": 5, "marvel_deepsearch_answer": "Introduction\n\nRecent advancements in search methods have focused on improving the detection threshold and sensitivity.

Here’s a breakdown of its significance:\n\n1. **Understanding Correlation Coefficient**: The correlation coefficient (often denoted as \\( r \\)) ranges from -1 to 1. A value of 0.1 suggests that there is a slight tendency for the two variables to increase together, but the relationship is not strong. In practical terms, this means that changes in one variable are not reliably associated with changes in the other.\n\n2. **Simulation Accuracy**: In simulations, particularly in astrophysics or cosmology, accuracy is crucial for making reliable predictions and analyses. A correlation coefficient of 0.1 might imply that the simulation's predictions do not strongly align with the observed data in the Y3 gold catalog. This could indicate that the simulation may not be accurately capturing the underlying physics or that the parameters used in the simulation need refinement.\n\n3. **Selection Criteria for Matching Objects**: When matching objects in a catalog, a low correlation coefficient like 0.1 suggests that the criteria used for matching may not be effective. If the matching criteria are based on parameters that are weakly correlated, it could lead to a high rate of false positives or negatives in the matching process. This could affect the quality of the catalog and the reliability of subsequent analyses.\n\n4. **Implications for Data Analysis**: A weak correlation may prompt researchers to reconsider their selection criteria or to explore additional variables that could provide a stronger relationship. It may also lead to further investigation into the reasons behind the weak correlation, such as potential systematic errors in the data or the need for more sophisticated modeling techniques.\n\n5. **Statistical Significance**: It’s also important to consider the statistical significance of the correlation. A correlation coefficient of 0.1 may not be statistically significant, meaning that the observed correlation could be due to random chance rather than a true underlying relationship.\n\nIn summary, a correlation coefficient of 0.1 in the context of simulation accuracy and object matching in the Y3 gold catalog suggests a weak relationship that may indicate issues with the simulation or the matching criteria, prompting further investigation and potential adjustments to improve accuracy and reliability.", "gpt4o_mini_score": 9, "marvel_standard_answer": "\nA correlation coefficient of 0.1 indicates a very weak positive linear relationship between simulated and actual properties of objects in the Y3 gold catalog, suggesting low simulation accuracy and potentially flawed selection criteria for matching objects.\n \n\nA correlation coefficient of 0.1 indicates a very weak positive linear relationship between simulated and actual properties of objects in the Y3 gold catalog, suggesting low simulation accuracy and potentially flawed selection criteria for matching objects.\n\n\n**Note:** This is a quick response generated by a language model, which may contain inaccuracies. \n                                                    For more detailed answers, please rephrase your question and be sure to request sources and supporting documents.\n                                                    ", "marvel_standard_score": 6, "marvel_deepsearch_answer": "Understanding the Correlation Coefficient in Simulation Accuracy and Object Matching\n\nThe correlation coefficient is a statistical measure that calculates the strength and direction of the relationship between two variables.

According to Investopedia, when the value of ρ is close to zero, generally between -0.1 and +0.1, the variables are said to have no linear relationship (or a very weak linear relationship) https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/032515/what-does-it-mean-if-correlation-coefficient-positive-negative-or-zero.asp. McBride and Altman categorize a coefficient of0.1 as \"Weak\" or \"Negligible\" and label it as \"Poor\". Gopal Das provides a simpler interpretation, where a correlation coefficient of0.1 implies no significant correlation between variables, as it falls within the range of -0.1 to +0.1, which signifies no correlation https://gopalcdas.com/2017/05/27/understanding-correlation-coefficient/.\n\nSignificance in the Context of Simulation Accuracy and Object Matching\n\nIn the context of simulation accuracy and object matching criteria in the Y3 gold catalog, a correlation coefficient of0.1 suggests that there is little to no correlation between the two variables. This implies a very weak linear relationship between simulation accuracy and object matching criteria.

In this scenario, two massive stars evolve together, and after they both go supernova, they can form a binary black hole system with low eccentricity. The evolution of the binary system, including mass transfer and common envelope phases, typically results in a more circular orbit.\n\nThese two cases highlight the different pathways through which binary black holes can form, each leading to distinct characteristics in their orbital dynamics and eventual merger processes.", "gpt4o_mini_score": 5, "marvel_standard_answer": "The two cases of eccentricity for the formation of stellar binary black holes (sBBHs) are:\n1. **High-eccentricity mergers**, often resulting from dynamical interactions in dense stellar environments or associated with dynamical formation.\n2. **Low-eccentricity mergers**, typically from the evolution of isolated binary star systems or associated with field binaries. \n</ANSWER>\n\n**Note:** This is a quick response generated by a language model, which may contain inaccuracies. \n                                                    For more detailed answers, please rephrase your question and be sure to request sources and supporting documents.\n                                                    ", "marvel_standard_score": 3, "marvel_deepsearch_answer": "KEY_FACTS\n\n<TASK_OUTPUT>\n\nThe two cases of eccentricity for the formation of stellar binary black holes (sBBHs) as discussed in the context are:\nAll sBBHs are already well circularized and have eccentricities close to \n0\n0 when they enter the LISA band [@\"url:https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8b44/epub\"].\nsBBHs may also be initially eccentric due to the natal kick received at the formation time of the second BH [@\"url:https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.01436.pdf\"]. </TASK_OUTPUT>\nFINER_DETAILS\n\n<TASK_OUTPUT> The formation of cosmic stellar binary black holes (sBBHs) may be dominated by two astrophysical channels, one of which is the EMBS channel [@\"url:https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8b44/epub\"].

The FAR quantifies the likelihood of a false positive detection, meaning it indicates how often a noise fluctuation might be incorrectly identified as a gravitational wave signal.\n\n### Significance of Detection Threshold and FAR:\n\n1. **Balancing Sensitivity and Reliability**: The detection threshold is set to ensure that the number of false alarms remains acceptably low while maximizing the chances of detecting genuine signals. A lower threshold increases sensitivity, allowing for the detection of weaker signals, but also raises the risk of false alarms. Conversely, a higher threshold reduces the likelihood of false alarms but may lead to missed detections of real signals.\n\n2. **Statistical Confidence**: The FAR provides a statistical basis for claiming a detection. For example, a FAR of 1 in 1,000 years means that, on average, one false alarm would be expected every 1,000 years of observation. This level of confidence is crucial for the scientific community to accept a detection as genuine.\n\n3. **Signal Removal**: In the context of gravitational wave searches, if a signal is detected and its FAR is above a certain threshold, it may be considered a candidate for further analysis. However, if the FAR is too high, it may lead to the removal of potentially detectable signals from the analysis. This is particularly important in crowded data environments where many noise sources can mimic gravitational wave signals.\n\n4. **Impact on Data Analysis**: The choice of detection threshold affects the data analysis pipeline. If the threshold is set too conservatively, real signals may be discarded, leading to missed opportunities for discovery. On the other hand, if the threshold is too lenient, the analysis may be overwhelmed by false positives, complicating the identification of true signals.\n\n5. **Post-Detection Analysis**: After a potential signal is detected, the FAR helps guide follow-up analyses, such as parameter estimation and source characterization. A low FAR can provide confidence that the detected signal is astrophysical in origin, leading to further investigations and potential multi-messenger astronomy efforts.\n\nIn summary, the detection threshold corresponding to FAR is a fundamental aspect of gravitational wave searches, influencing the trade-off between sensitivity and reliability, guiding the acceptance of detections, and impacting the overall analysis strategy. Properly managing this threshold is essential for the success of gravitational wave astronomy and the accurate identification of astrophysical events.", "gpt4o_mini_score": 9, "marvel_standard_answer": "The detection threshold corresponding to false alarm rates (FAR) in gravitational wave searches is significant because it determines the balance between false positives and true positives.

The FAR is a measure of the probability of incorrectly identifying a signal as a gravitational wave when it is actually noise. A detection threshold is set to minimize the FAR while maximizing the detection efficiency of real gravitational wave signals.\n\nA high detection threshold may reduce the number of false alarms but also risks removing detectable signals. Conversely, a low detection threshold may increase the detection rate but also increases the false alarm rate. Therefore, finding the optimal detection threshold is crucial to balance the trade-off between detection efficiency and false alarm rate.\n\nThe FAR is related to the p-value or the significance level, often denoted as \n𝑝\np or \n𝛼\nα. For a given detection threshold, the FAR can be calculated using the equation \n𝛼\n=\n1\n−\ncdf\n(\n𝜆\n)\nα=1−cdf(λ), where \n𝜆\nλ is the detection threshold and \ncdf\ncdf is the cumulative distribution function of the noise distribution.\n\nThe optimal detection threshold can be determined by maximizing the detection efficiency while keeping the false alarm rate below a certain threshold, often \n10\n−\n3\n10\n−3\n or \n1\n%\n1%. The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, which plots the true positive rate against the false positive rate, is a useful tool for evaluating the performance of a detection algorithm.\n\nThe detection threshold can be determined using various methods, including the Neyman-Pearson lemma, which provides an optimal decision rule for hypothesis testing. The likelihood ratio test (LRT) is another popular method for determining the detection threshold.\n\nIn gravitational wave detection, the detection threshold is often determined using a combination of these methods and simulations. The false alarm rate can also be estimated using the expected number of false alarms, which can be calculated using the equation \n𝑁\nfalse\n=\n𝛼\n×\n𝑁\ntotal\nN\nfalse\n\t​\n\n=α×N\ntotal\n\t​\n\n, where \n𝑁\ntotal\nN\ntotal\n\t​\n\n is the total number of trials.\n\nThe detection threshold can also be expressed in terms of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), which is a measure of the signal strength relative to the noise. A higher SNR corresponds to a lower detection threshold and a higher detection efficiency.\n\nThe significance of the detection threshold corresponding to FAR in gravitational wave searches is highlighted in various studies, including the detection of GW150914, a gravitational-wave signal from the merger of two stellar-mass black holes.\n\nThe detection threshold in gravitational wave searches is typically related to a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) threshold, commonly around SNR = 8, though it can vary based on search parameters and detector characteristics. For instance, specific thresholds of \n10.\n5\n−\n2.4\n+\n2.1\n10.5\n−2.4\n+2.1\n\t​\n\n, \n11.\n2\n−\n1.4\n+\n1.2\n11.2\n−1.4\n+1.2\n\t​\n\n, and \n9.\n1\n−\n0.5\n+\n0.5\n9.1\n−0.5\n+0.5\n\t​\n\n have been reported for certain observing runs. Signals must exceed this threshold to be considered detectable, impacting the detection efficiency of signals with varying strengths. Weaker signals (those with SNR close to the threshold) are more susceptible to being missed or confused with instrumental glitches, reducing detection efficiency. The efficiency can significantly decrease for signals with SNR just above the threshold, as seen in cases where detection efficiency drops from 90% to less than 1% due to signal-consistency tests.\n\nThe consequences of setting a detection threshold that prioritizes minimizing false alarms versus one that maximizes detection efficiency in gravitational wave searches are as follows:\n\nA lower false alarm rate (FAR) threshold, such as \n𝐹\n𝐴\n𝑅\n≲\n10\n−\n2\nFAR≲10\n−2\n yr\n−\n1\n−1\n or \n10\n−\n2\n yr\n−\n1\n10\n−2\n yr\n−1\n, prioritizes minimizing false alarms, which may lead to more confident detections but with larger typical sky localization areas.\nA higher FAR threshold, such as \n𝐹\n𝐴\n𝑅\n≤\n12\n \nyr\n−\n1\nFAR≤12yr\n−1\n or \n12\n yr\n−\n1\n12 yr\n−1\n, prioritizes maximizing detection efficiency, which may admit more candidates but with coarser localizations.\n\nThe sensitivity for a fully coherent search for finding sources with average orientation for a 1% False Alarm Rate and 10% False Dismissal Rate is given by \nℎ\n0\n≈\n11\n𝑆\n/\n𝑇\n𝑜\n𝑏\n𝑠\nh\n0\n\t​\n\n≈11\nS/T\nobs\n\t​\n\n\t​\n\n.

One crucial aspect of gravitational wave searches is the detection threshold corresponding to false alarm rates (FAR), which directly impacts the potential removal of detectable signals. In this article, we will discuss the significance of FAR in gravitational wave searches and its implications for the detection of real signals.\n\nThe Role of False Alarm Rates in Gravitational Wave Detection\n\nThe false alarm rate (FAR) is a critical parameter in gravitational wave detection, representing the probability of incorrectly identifying a signal as a gravitational wave when it is actually noise. The detection threshold is set to minimize the FAR while maximizing the detection efficiency of real gravitational wave signals. A higher detection threshold may reduce the number of false alarms but also risks removing detectable signals.\n\nMethods for Determining Detection Thresholds\n\nSeveral methods are used to determine the detection threshold, including the Neyman-Pearson lemma, the likelihood ratio test (LRT), and the use of Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves. The ROC curve plots the true positive rate against the false positive rate, providing a useful tool for evaluating the performance of a detection algorithm. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) is a measure of the algorithm's performance, with higher values indicating better performance.\n\nThe Impact of FAR on Gravitational Wave Searches\n\nThe FAR has a significant impact on gravitational wave searches, particularly regarding the potential removal of detectable signals. A lower threshold for the FAR would allow for the detection of more false positive events. The q-value, a measure of the false discovery rate (FDR), is a relevant concept in this context. The FDR is expressed as \n𝐹\n𝐷\n𝑅\n=\n𝐹\n𝑃\n𝐹\n𝑃\n+\n𝑇\n𝑃\nFDR=\nFP+TP\nFP\n\t​\n\n, where FP is the number of false positives and TP is the number of true positives.\n\nDetection Thresholds in Practice\n\nIn practice, detection thresholds are determined dynamically by the CFAR detector, based on the known background clutter distribution and a preset false alarm rate. The LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC) uses various techniques to reduce false alarms, including vetoing non-astrophysical transient noises. The efficiency and deadtime of vetoes are evaluated using metrics such as the efficiency \n𝐸\nE and deadtime \n𝐷\nD.\n\nAdjusting Detection Thresholds for Non-Gaussian Noise\n\nAdjusting the detection threshold to account for non-Gaussian noise distributions can significantly affect the false alarm rate and detection efficiency in gravitational wave searches. According to Document 2, \"Adjusting the detection threshold to account for non-Gaussian noise distributions can affect the false alarm rate and detection efficiency in gravitational wave searches.\" This is because non-Gaussian noise transients can produce large signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) where no signal is present, potentially leading to false alarms.\n\nThe presence of non-Gaussian noise can reduce the sensitivity of gravitational wave searches, as mentioned in Document 2. However, techniques such as the χ2 test, which is constructed by performing a matched filter with additional templates orthogonal to the search template, can help mitigate this issue. Document 2 also mentions that a new χ2 test using stochastic gradient descent to train a set of tunable parameters within the model was implemented, effectively down-weighting the noise while leaving the signal population relatively unaffected.\n\nOptimization of Detection Probability\n\nThe optimization of the detection probability, \n𝑃\n1\n→\n𝑃\n𝑂\n𝑃\n𝑇\n1\nP\n1\n\t​\n\n→P\nOPT\n\t​\n\n1, for every value of the probability of false alarm, \n𝑃\n0\n=\n𝑃\n0\n∗\nP\n0\n\t​\n\n=P\n0\n∗\n\t​\n\n, maximizes the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, which is a standard measure of any detection algorithm’s performance. The curve \n𝑃\n𝑂\n𝑃\n𝑇\n1\n(\n𝑃\n0\n)\nP\nOPT\n\t​\n\n1(P\n0\n\t​\n\n) is called the ROC curve.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the detection threshold corresponding to false alarm rates (FAR) plays a crucial role in gravitational wave searches. The FAR directly impacts the potential removal of detectable signals, and its significance lies in distinguishing between real and noise triggers. By understanding the methods for determining detection thresholds and the impact of FAR on gravitational wave searches, researchers can optimize the detection of real signals while minimizing false alarms.\n\nReferences\n[1] - https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1740-9713.01488\n[2] - https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12117\n[3] - https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation?paperid=71246\n[4] - https://inspirehep.net/literature/2115306\n[5] - https://www.raa-journal.org/issues/all/2022/v22n11/202211/P020221110637813974286.pdf\n[6] - https://academic.oup.com/ptep/article/2021/12/123F01/6409143\n[7] - https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.109.103004\n[8] - https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000astro.ph..7308I/abstract\n[9] - https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.061102.pdf\n[10] - https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5478100/\n[11] - http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013NJPh...15e3027M/abstract\n[12] - https://lscsoft.docs.ligo.org/raven/joint_far.html\n[13] - https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/1468/1/012222/pdf\n[14] - https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/16/19/3691\n[15] - https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20140010828/downloads/20140010828.pdf\n[16] - https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.107.023027.pdf\n[17] - https://repository.lsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2630&context=physics_astronomy_pubs\n[18] - https://dcc.ligo.org/LIGO-P1500247-v25/public\n[19] - https://inspirehep.net/literature/649687", "marvel_deepsearch_score": 8, "evaluation_model_type": "openai", "evaluation_model_name": "gpt-4o-mini", "qa_model_type": "openai", "qa_model_name": "gpt-4o-mini", "gpt4o_mini_answer_relevancy": 0.95, "gpt4o_mini_answer_correctness": 0.8, "gpt4o_mini_faithfulness": 0.7, "marvel_standard_answer_relevancy": 0.92, "marvel_standard_answer_correctness": 0.85, "marvel_standard_faithfulness": 0.7, "marvel_deepsearch_answer_relevancy": 0.9, "marvel_deepsearch_answer_correctness": 0.3, "marvel_deepsearch_faithfulness": 0.8}

This event involved the merger of two black holes, with masses around 85 and 66 solar masses, resulting in a final black hole of about 142 solar masses. The mass ratio of 2 indicates that the two black holes were not equal in mass, which is somewhat unusual compared to many binary black hole mergers observed previously, where the mass ratios tend to be closer to 1.\n\nThe significance of this mass ratio lies in the implications it has for our understanding of black hole formation and evolution. A mass ratio of 2 suggests that the black holes may have formed through different channels, such as:\n\n1. **Stellar Evolution**: The black holes could have originated from different progenitor stars with varying initial masses, leading to different evolutionary paths.\n2. **Dynamical Formation**: The merger could have occurred in a dense stellar environment, such as a globular cluster, where interactions between stars can lead to the formation of binaries with unequal masses.\n3. **Isolated Binary Evolution**: The event may also indicate that some binary systems evolve in isolation, where one star evolves more rapidly than the other, leading to a significant mass difference.\n\nTo improve our understanding of binary formation channels, future observations are expected to focus on several key areas:\n\n1. **Increased Sensitivity**: Upcoming upgrades to gravitational wave detectors like LIGO and Virgo, as well as new observatories like the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, will enhance sensitivity and allow for the detection of more distant and fainter events, providing a larger sample size for analysis.\n\n2. **Multi-Messenger Astronomy**: Coordinated observations across different wavelengths (e.g., electromagnetic signals, neutrinos) can provide additional context about the environments in which these mergers occur, helping to distinguish between formation channels.\n\n3. **Population Studies**: Analyzing the population of detected black hole mergers will help identify trends in mass distributions, spin, and other properties, which can be linked to specific formation scenarios.\n\n4. **Simulations and Models**: Improved theoretical models and simulations of stellar evolution and binary dynamics will help interpret the observed data and predict the expected distributions of black hole masses and mass ratios.\n\nBy combining these observational and theoretical efforts, astronomers hope to gain a clearer picture of how black holes form and evolve, particularly in the context of events like GW190521 that challenge existing models.", "gpt4o_mini_score": 10, "marvel_standard_answer": "<QUERY> What is the significance of the mass ratio of2 in the context of gravitational wave event gw190521, and what future observations are expected to improve understanding of binary formation channels? </QUERY>\n\nAfter carefully reading the provided <TEXT> from various documents, I will perform a needle-in-a-haystack search to find the <ANSWER> to the <QUERY>.\n\nThe significance of the mass ratio of 2 in the context of gravitational wave event GW190521 is discussed in several documents.\n\nAccording to **Document3**, the significance of the mass ratio of 2 in the context of gravitational wave event GW190521, along with future observations expected to improve understanding of binary formation channels, is discussed in the context of the most massive binary black hole merger confidently detected by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration.\n\n**Document5** discusses the hypothesis that GW190521 formed dynamically, supported by its high mass, with orbital eccentricity also being a possible signature of dynamic formation.\n\n**Document2** mentions that the GW190521 event is a gravitational wave signal emitted during the collision of two black holes of mass $85$ and $66$ times the mass of our Sun in a binary system, forming a remnant black hole of mass $142$ times the mass of the Sun.\n\nThe mass ratio of 2 is specifically significant because it hints at potential insights into binary formation channels.\n\nFuture observations are expected to improve understanding of binary formation channels.\n\nAs mentioned in **Document4**, detection prospects would improve with strategies such as multiband detections requiring a lower SNR threshold.\n\n<ANSWER> The mass ratio of 2 in the context of gravitational wave event GW190521 is significant as it hints at potential insights into binary formation channels.

This event, characterized by the merger of two black holes with masses approximately 85 and 66 times that of the Sun, presents a unique opportunity to study the properties of binary black holes and their formation channels.\n\n## The Event GW190521: A Record-Breaking Heavyweight\n\nThe GW190521 event features merging components of approximately 85 and 66 solar masses, making it a record-breaking heavyweight event [1]. This observation of unusually large black holes hints at potential insights into binary formation channels, with future observations expected to further elucidate these processes. Analyzing GW190521 with two different priors for the binary's masses yields component masses of $m_{src1}=168^{+15}_{-61} M⊙$ and $m_{src2}=16^{+33}_{-3} M⊙$ for the uniform in mass-ratio prior [2].\n\n## Implications of the Mass Ratio\n\nThe significance of the mass ratio of 2 in the context of GW190521 is particularly noteworthy. This event is the first confident observation of a binary black hole merger with a total mass $M>100M⊙$. The mass ratio and the large masses of the component black holes suggest that GW190521 may have formed through dynamical interactions, such as those occurring in globular clusters or active galactic nuclei (AGN) disks [3].\n\n## Dynamical Formation Channels\n\nThe hypothesis that GW190521 formed dynamically is supported by its high mass, with orbital eccentricity also being a possible signature of dynamic formation [4]. If indeed GW190521 lived in an AGN disk, it could be the harbinger of a significant population of binary BHs dwelling in gas-rich environments that will be detected in the coming years by ground and space detectors [5]. The large gas densities and the presence of supermassive BHs (SMBHs) at the center of AGN disks could produce observable effects in gravitational wave (GW) signals.\n\n## Future Observations and Binary Formation Channels\n\nFuture observations are expected to improve understanding of binary formation channels. The LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration's continued detections will provide more insights into the properties of binary black holes and their formation channels [6]. The analysis of GW190521 utilizing phenomenological models has already provided valuable information on the event [7]. Further studies, such as those presented in [8] and [9], will continue to shed light on the astrophysical formation channels of binary black hole systems and their correlations between mass, spin, and redshift distributions.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe detection of GW190521 has marked a significant milestone in the study of gravitational waves and binary black hole systems. The event's unique properties, including its large mass ratio and component masses, offer insights into the formation channels of binary black holes. As future observations continue to unveil the secrets of the universe, our understanding of binary formation channels will be refined, and the mysteries of GW190521 will be further illuminated.\n\n## References\n\n[1] [https://aasnova.org/2020/11/06/eccentricity-spin-and-the-origins-of-colliding-black-holes/](https://aasnova.org/2020/11/06/eccentricity-spin-and-the-origins-of-colliding-black-holes/)\n[2] [https://www.aei.mpg.de/612558/gw190521-may-be-an-intermediate-mass-ratio-inspiral](https://www.aei.mpg.de/612558/gw190521-may-be-an-intermediate-mass-ratio-inspiral)\n[3] [https://www.ligo-india.in/outreach/detections/gw190521/](https://www.ligo-india.in/outreach/detections/gw190521/)\n[4] [https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/abbe26](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/abbe26)\n[5] [https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.106.064056](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.106.064056)\n[6] [https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.108.123039](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.108.123039)\n[7] [https://inspirehep.net/literature/1863177](https://inspirehep.net/literature/1863177)\n[8] [https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.109.103006](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.109.103006)", "marvel_standard_score": 7, "marvel_deepsearch_answer": "The detection of the gravitational wave event GW190521 by the LIGO and Virgo collaborations has opened a new window into the universe, offering insights into the formation of binary black hole systems.

Detection prospects would improve with strategies such as multiband detections requiring a lower SNR threshold.\n\nThe expected improvements in understanding binary formation channels through future gravitational wave observations, particularly with regards to the detection of high-mass mergers like GW190521 and their implications for astrophysical environments, include:\n\nBuilding a statistical picture of black-hole binary formations through continued detections by LIGO-Virgo.\nInsights from high-mass mergers indicating formation through earlier mergers of smaller black holes.\nUnderstanding the role of astrophysical environments like globular clusters or nuclear star clusters in massive mergers.\nDetermining the production rate of intermediate-mass black hole binary mergers.\nIdentifying dynamical formation channels and hierarchical mergers in AGN disks.\nRefining analysis and models to interpret extreme events like GW190521.\n\nThese improvements are supported by multiple sources, including https://cplberry.com/2020/09/02/gw190521/, https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.106.064056, https://dcc.ligo.org/LIGO-T2100334/public, https://aasnova.org/2020/11/06/eccentricity-spin-and-the-origins-of-colliding-black-holes/, https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.03439.pdf, and https://phys.org/news/2025-07-ligo-virgo-kagra-massive-black.html.\n\nThe detection of GW190521 has marked a significant milestone in the study of gravitational waves and binary black hole systems. The event's unique properties, including its large mass ratio and component masses, offer insights into the formation channels of binary black holes. As future observations continue to unveil the secrets of the universe, our understanding of binary formation channels will be refined, and the mysteries of GW190521 will be further illuminated.\n\nThe Event GW190521: A Record-Breaking Heavyweight\n\nThe GW190521 event features merging components of approximately 85 and 66 solar masses, making it a record-breaking heavyweight event. This observation of unusually large black holes hints at potential insights into binary formation channels, with future observations expected to further elucidate these processes. Analyzing GW190521 with two different priors for the binary's masses yields component masses of \n𝑚\n𝑠\n𝑟\n𝑐\n1\n=\n16\n8\n−\n61\n+\n15\n𝑀\n⊙\nm\nsrc1\n\t​\n\n=168\n−61\n+15\n\t​\n\nM⊙ and \n𝑚\n𝑠\n𝑟\n𝑐\n2\n=\n1\n6\n−\n3\n+\n33\n𝑀\n⊙\nm\nsrc2\n\t​\n\n=16\n−3\n+33\n\t​\n\nM⊙ for the uniform in mass-ratio prior.\n\nImplications of the Mass Ratio\n\nThe significance of the mass ratio of 2 in the context of GW190521 is particularly noteworthy. This event is the first confident observation of a binary black hole merger with a total mass \n𝑀\n>\n100\n𝑀\n⊙\nM>100M⊙. The mass ratio and the large masses of the component black holes suggest that GW190521 may have formed through dynamical interactions, such as those occurring in globular clusters or active galactic nuclei (AGN) disks.\n\nDynamical Formation Channels\n\nThe hypothesis that GW190521 formed dynamically is supported by its high mass, with orbital eccentricity also being a possible signature of dynamic formation. If indeed GW190521 lived in an AGN disk, it could be the harbinger of a significant population of binary BHs dwelling in gas-rich environments that will be detected in the coming years by ground and space detectors. The large gas densities and the presence of supermassive BHs at the center of AGN disks could produce observable effects in gravitational wave (GW) signals.\n\nFuture Observations and Binary Formation Channels\n\nFuture observations are expected to improve understanding of binary formation channels. The LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration's continued detections will provide more insights into the properties of binary black holes and their formation channels. The analysis of GW190521 utilizing phenomenological models has already provided valuable information on the event. Further studies will continue to shed light on the astrophysical formation channels of binary black hole systems and their correlations between mass, spin, and redshift distributions.\n\nConclusion", "marvel_deepsearch_score": 9, "evaluation_model_type": "openai", "evaluation_model_name": "gpt-4o-mini", "qa_model_type": "openai", "qa_model_name": "gpt-4o-mini", "gpt4o_mini_answer_relevancy": 0.92, "gpt4o_mini_answer_correctness": 0.87, "gpt4o_mini_faithfulness": 0.05, "marvel_standard_answer_relevancy": 0.98, "marvel_standard_answer_correctness": 0.87, "marvel_standard_faithfulness": 0.92, "marvel_deepsearch_answer_relevancy": 0.92, "marvel_deepsearch_answer_correctness": 0.87, "marvel_deepsearch_faithfulness": 0.83}

Here are some key avenues that are likely to enhance our knowledge in this area:\n\n1. **Direct Detection Experiments**: Several direct detection experiments are currently operational or planned, such as LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ), XENONnT, and PandaX. These experiments aim to detect weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) in the 10 - 100 GeV mass range through their interactions with ordinary matter. As these experiments increase in sensitivity and exposure, they will be able to probe deeper into the parameter space of WIMP models.\n\n2. **Indirect Detection**: Observations of cosmic rays, gamma rays, and neutrinos can provide indirect evidence of dark matter annihilation or decay. Instruments like the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA), and the IceCube Neutrino Observatory are expected to provide valuable data. Anomalies in cosmic ray spectra or gamma-ray emissions from regions with high DM density (like the Galactic Center) could hint at the properties of DM particles.\n\n3. **Collider Experiments**: High-energy particle colliders, such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), continue to search for signs of dark matter through missing energy signatures in particle collisions. While the LHC has not yet found definitive evidence for DM, future colliders (like the proposed Future Circular Collider) could explore higher energy scales and potentially discover new physics related to dark matter.\n\n4. **Astrophysical Surveys**: Large-scale surveys, such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), will provide detailed maps of the distribution of galaxies and dark matter in the universe. These surveys can help refine models of DM distribution and structure formation, providing insights into the nature of dark matter.\n\n5. **Theoretical Developments**: Advances in theoretical models, including supersymmetry, extra dimensions, and other beyond-the-Standard-Model physics, could provide new frameworks for understanding dark matter. Improved simulations of structure formation and the behavior of DM in various astrophysical contexts will also contribute to our understanding.\n\n6. **Multi-Messenger Astronomy**: The combination of observations across different wavelengths (electromagnetic, gravitational waves, neutrinos) can provide a more comprehensive picture of the universe and the role of dark matter. For instance, gravitational wave observations from mergers of compact objects can inform us about the distribution of DM in galaxies.\n\n7. **New Detection Techniques**: Innovations in detection technologies, such as quantum sensors or novel materials for direct detection, could lead to breakthroughs in identifying dark matter interactions.\n\nIn summary, the combination of direct and indirect detection efforts, collider experiments, astrophysical surveys, and theoretical advancements holds great promise for improving our understanding of dark matter in the 10 - 100 GeV mass range. As these efforts progress, we may be able to either identify the particle nature of dark matter or rule out certain models, leading to a deeper understanding of this fundamental component of the universe.", "gpt4o_mini_score": 9, "marvel_standard_answer": "The prospects for improving the understanding of dark matter (DM) in the 10-100 GeV mass range are promising.

Recent observations suggest that approximately 85% of the universe's total matter content consists of non-baryonic matter, commonly referred to as dark matter due to its lack of electromagnetic interaction or luminosity [1]. This article aims to discuss the prospects for improving the understanding of dark matter particle nature and its distribution in the universe, particularly in the 10-100 GeV mass range.\n\nAstrophysical and cosmological evidence suggests that dark matter is a crucial component of the universe. However, the particle nature of DM remains an open question, with no suitable candidate existing within the Standard Model [2]. Proposed solutions range from relativistic thermal relic particles to condensates of weakly interacting non-relativistic light bosons.\n\nThe prospects for improving the understanding of dark matter particle nature and its distribution in the universe involve the interplay between complementary probes, including experimental dark matter research and astrophysical probes [3]. Specifically, the XENONnT experiment has presented the latest results from a blind analysis to search for WIMPs with a mass above 10 GeV/c^2, combining both first and second science runs for a total live time of ~283 days [4].\n\nNew theories and candidates are being proposed to explain the nature of dark matter. For example, a newly proposed DM candidate would not only be lighter than existing hypothetical suspects, but it would also be self-annihilating, with particles annihilating into electron-positron pairs, which then interact with the surrounding gas [6]. This process could provide the energy needed to strip electrons away from neutral atoms, a process called ionization, in dense gas in the center of the Milky Way.\n\nThe prospects for improving the understanding of dark matter particle nature and its distribution in the universe appear promising, with experiments being proposed for collecting data in the next 5-10 years [7]. These experiments are expected to explore the mass region from a GeV to a few TeV, which aligns with the Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP) paradigm for DM. This mass range includes the 10-100 GeV range of interest.\n\nReferences\n\n[1] Astrophysical and cosmological evidence suggests that approximately \n85\n%\n85% of the Universe's total matter content consists of non-baryonic matter, commonly referred to as dark matter (DM) due to its lack of electromagnetic interaction or luminosity.

Here's a breakdown of their significance:\n\n1. **Characteristic Mass ($m_{c}$)**:\n   - The characteristic mass represents the typical mass scale of the primordial black holes formed in the early universe. It is a key parameter in determining the dynamics of PBHs, including their gravitational interactions and the likelihood of forming binary systems.\n   - The value of $m_{c}$ influences the abundance of PBHs at different mass scales. For instance, if $m_{c}$ is relatively low (e.g., in the range of stellar masses), it may lead to a higher density of PBHs, which can enhance the probability of PBH mergers and binary formation.\n   - The characteristic mass also affects the gravitational wave signals produced by PBH mergers, which can be detected by observatories like LIGO and Virgo, providing a way to probe the existence and properties of PBHs.\n\n2. **Width of the Mass Function ($\\sigma$)**:\n   - The width of the mass function describes the spread of masses around the characteristic mass $m_{c}$. A narrow mass function (small $\\sigma$) means that most PBHs have masses close to $m_{c}$, while a wide mass function (large $\\sigma$) indicates a broader range of masses.\n   - The width impacts the dynamics of PBH interactions. A narrow mass function can lead to more efficient gravitational interactions and a higher likelihood of forming binaries, as similar mass PBHs will interact more strongly than those with a wide range of masses.\n   - Additionally, the width of the mass function can influence the merger rates of PBHs, which is important for understanding the gravitational wave signals that may arise from these mergers.\n\n3. **Fraction of Dark Matter Made Up of Primordial Black Holes ($f_{pbh}$)**:\n   - The fraction $f_{pbh}$ quantifies the contribution of PBHs to the total dark matter density in the universe. This parameter is critical for understanding the role of PBHs in cosmology and their potential to explain dark matter.\n   - A higher value of $f_{pbh}$ suggests that a significant portion of dark matter could be composed of PBHs, which has implications for structure formation, cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies, and the evolution of galaxies.\n   - The fraction also affects the likelihood of PBH mergers. If a substantial fraction of dark matter is in the form of PBHs, the density of PBHs in the universe increases, enhancing the chances of PBH interactions and binary formation.\n\nIn summary, $m_{c}$, $\\sigma$, and $f_{pbh}$ are interconnected parameters that influence the formation, dynamics, and observational signatures of primordial black holes. They play a vital role in understanding the nature of dark matter and the potential for PBHs to contribute to gravitational wave signals through binary mergers.", "gpt4o_mini_score": 10, "marvel_standard_answer": "The parameters $m_{c}$, $\\sigma$, and $f_{pbh}$ are crucial in understanding primordial black holes (PBHs) and their potential role in forming binary systems.

The framework elucidates the dependence of the maximum PBH density on the form of observational constraints.\n\nThe Formation of Primordial Black Hole Binaries\n\nThe characteristic mass (\n𝑚\n𝑐\nm\nc\n\t​\n\n), the width of the mass function (\n𝜎\nσ), and the fraction of dark matter made up of primordial black holes (\n𝑓\n𝑝\n𝑏\nℎ\nf\npbh\n\t​\n\n) affect the formation of primordial black hole binaries in the following ways:\n\nThey influence the black hole mass function and binary formation rate predictions.\nThey impact the merger rate of primordial black holes.\nThe fraction \n𝑓\n𝑝\n𝑏\nℎ\nf\npbh\n\t​\n\n affects the contribution of primordial black holes to dark matter and the disruption of binaries, with a significant fraction of primordial black holes being disrupted for \n𝑓\n𝑝\n𝑏\nℎ\n=\n100\n%\nf\npbh\n\t​\n\n=100%.\nThe suppression factor \n𝑠\ns for binary disruption depends on \n𝑓\n𝑝\n𝑏\nℎ\nf\npbh\n\t​\n\n, with \n𝑠\n∼\n1\ns∼1 for \n𝑓\n𝑝\n𝑏\nℎ\n<\n1\n%\nf\npbh\n\t​\n\n<1% and \n𝑠\n=\n1\n%\ns=1% for \n𝑓\n𝑝\n𝑏\nℎ\n=\n100\n%\nf\npbh\n\t​\n\n=100%.\nObservational Constraints on \n𝑓\n𝑝\n𝑏\nℎ\nf\npbh\n\t​\n\n\nThe observational constraints on \n𝑓\n𝑝\n𝑏\nℎ\nf\npbh\n\t​\n\n as a function of \n𝑚\n𝑐\nm\nc\n\t​\n\n and \n𝜎\nσ suggest that primordial black holes can constitute all dark matter in specific mass windows.

They are considered as a potential candidate for dark matter, and their mass range is quite broad. The mass range of PBHs that could contribute to dark matter is typically from about \\(10^{-16}\\) solar masses (or around \\(10^{15}\\) grams) up to several hundred solar masses (or more). \n\nThe most significant range for PBHs as dark matter candidates is often considered to be between \\(10^{-12}\\) solar masses (about \\(10^{18}\\) grams) and \\(10^{2}\\) solar masses. This range is particularly interesting because it overlaps with the mass scales where various astrophysical and cosmological constraints apply.\n\nWhen it comes to Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), which are another leading candidate for dark matter, there are specific annihilation constraints that come into play. WIMPs are expected to annihilate into standard model particles, and this annihilation can produce detectable signals, such as gamma rays or neutrinos. The constraints on WIMP annihilation rates from observations (like those from the cosmic microwave background, direct detection experiments, and indirect detection through astrophysical observations) can limit the allowed mass and cross-section parameters for WIMPs.\n\nFor PBHs, the relationship with WIMP annihilation constraints is nuanced. If PBHs were to make up a significant fraction of dark matter, they could potentially influence the formation of structure in the universe and the cosmic microwave background. However, if PBHs are too massive, they would not provide the right density fluctuations to seed structure formation in the early universe. \n\nMoreover, if PBHs were to account for dark matter, they would not annihilate like WIMPs do, since they are not particles but rather compact objects. Therefore, the constraints on WIMP annihilation do not directly apply to PBHs, but the existence of PBHs in certain mass ranges could affect the interpretation of WIMP searches and the overall dark matter density in the universe.\n\nIn summary, the mass range of PBHs that could provide dark matter is from about \\(10^{-16}\\) to several hundred solar masses, with a significant focus on the range from \\(10^{-12}\\) to \\(10^{2}\\) solar masses.

The contribution of PBHs to dark matter is constrained by WIMP annihilation effects, particularly in the context of ultracompact minihalos (UCMHs) and the isotropic gamma-ray background (IGRB), with recent findings indicating that previous constraints using the IGRB may have been overestimated. </ANSWER>\n\n# The Mass Range of Primordial Black Holes as Dark Matter and WIMP Annihilation Constraints\n====================================================================================\n\n## Introduction\n\nPrimordial black holes (PBHs) are a hypothetical form of black hole that could have formed in the early universe. They are considered a candidate for dark matter, which is a type of matter that does not emit, absorb, or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, making it invisible to our telescopes. The mass range of PBHs that could potentially provide dark matter is a topic of ongoing research, with various studies suggesting different ranges.\n\n## Mass Range of PBHs\n\nThe mass range of PBHs that could potentially provide dark matter is vast, with initial masses ranging from $10^{-8}$ kg (the so-called Planck relics) to more than thousands of solar masses [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primordial_black_hole]. However, PBHs with masses lower than $10^{11}$ kg would not have survived to the present due to Hawking radiation, which causes complete evaporation in a time much shorter than the age of the Universe.\n\nStudies suggest that PBHs could provide the right density to make up all dark matter in the universe without violating constraints in the mass range of $10^{12}$–$10^{13}$ kg [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primordial_black_hole]. Additionally, PBHs in the range $100–10^4$ solar masses contribute importantly to dark matter, at least in the simplest conservative model.\n\n## Constraints on PBHs\n\nThe abundance of PBHs, $\\beta(M_H)$, is given by $\\beta(M_H) =2 \\int_{\\delta_c}^{\\infty} P(\\delta) d\\delta \\sim $\\frac{\\sigma(M_H)}{\\delta_c}$ \\exp $\\left($ $-\\frac{\\delta_c^2}{2\\sigma^2(M_H)}$ $\\right)$,$ where $\\delta_c$ is the critical density contrast, $\\sigma(M_H)$ is the mass variance, and $P(\\delta)$ is the probability distribution of primordial density perturbations [https://aeon.co/essays/how-primordial-black-holes-might-explain-dark-matter.pdf].\n\nConstraints on the fraction of DM in the form of PBHs, $f_{PBH}$, with mass $M_{PBH}$ are as follows:\n\n* Evaporation: $f_{PBH} \\lesssim0.4$ for $M_{PBH} \\sim10^{16} -10^{17} g$\n* Microlensing: $f_{PBH} \\lesssim0.1$ for $M_{PBH} \\sim10^{-6} -10^{1} M_{\\odot}$\n* Gravitational Waves: $f_{PBH} \\lesssim10^{-2}$ for $M_{PBH} \\sim10^{1} -10^{3} M_{\\odot}$\n* Dynamical Effects: $f_{PBH} \\lesssim0.002 -0.004$ for $M_{PBH} \\sim10^{4} M_{\\odot}$\n* Accretion: $f_{PBH} \\lesssim10^{-3}$ for $M_{PBH} \\sim10^{2} -10^{3} M_{\\odot}$ [https://aeon.co/essays/how-primordial-black-holes-might-explain-dark-matter.pdf]\n\n## WIMP Annihilation Constraints\n\nWeakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) are a type of particle that could make up dark matter. The annihilation of WIMPs around PBHs could provide constraints on the mass range of PBHs that could potentially provide dark matter.\n\nThe constraints on WIMP annihilation in ultracompact minihalos (UCMHs) around PBHs are investigated, considering a range of WIMP masses, annihilation channels, cross sections, and PBH mass functions [https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.09481]. The analysis reveals that constraints derived using the isotropic gamma-ray background (IGRB) have been significantly overestimated, and limits obtained using observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) are typically stronger than, or comparable to, those coming from the IGRB.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the mass range of primordial black holes that could potentially provide dark matter is constrained by various astrophysical and cosmological observations. While PBHs with masses $M_{PBH} \\gtrsim10^{-11} M_{\\odot}$ cannot comprise the entirety of dark matter, a subdominant population of these objects can have profound astrophysical consequences. Further research is needed to determine the exact mass range of PBHs that could provide dark matter and to understand the implications of WIMP annihilation constraints on this mass range.\n\n## References\n\n* [https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.09481](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.09481)\n* [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0550321324000609](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0550321324000609)\n* [https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.106.063538](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.106.063538)\n* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primordial_black_hole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primordial_black_hole)\n* [https://aeon.co/essays/how-primordial-black-holes-might-explain-dark-matter.pdf](https://aeon.co/essays/how-primordial-black-holes-might-explain-dark-matter.pdf)", "marvel_standard_score": 9, "marvel_deepsearch_answer": "The Mass Range of Primordial Black Holes as Dark Matter and WIMP Annihilation Constraints\nIntroduction\n\nPrimordial black holes (PBHs) are a hypothetical form of black hole that could have formed in the early universe.

We examine the guidelines provided by various funding agencies, journals, and research institutions to understand the importance of transparency in research funding. The article highlights the specific requirements for disclosing funding sources, including the use of grant numbers and acknowledgments.\n\nIntroduction\n\nResearch funding is a crucial aspect of academic and scientific endeavors. However, the lack of transparency in funding sources can lead to concerns about the integrity of research findings. In recent years, there has been a growing emphasis on disclosing funding sources in research publications. This article reviews the policies and requirements for acknowledging funding sources in research publications, with a focus on the guidelines provided by various funding agencies, journals, and research institutions.\n\nFunding Agencies' Requirements\n\nThe National Institutes of Health (NIH) requires that every publication resulting from research that was fully or partially funded by the NIH must list the specific grant number(s) that supported the work. This includes a specific acknowledgment format: \"Research reported in this publication/press release was supported by [name of the Institute(s), Center, or other NIH offices] of the National Institutes of Health under award number [specific NIH grant number(s) in this format: R01GM987654].\" (Source: Document 6)\n\nThe National Science Foundation (NSF) also requires that grant recipients provide open access to the published results of the research that they fund. (Source: Document 19)\n\nJournal Policies\n\nPLOS authors are required to declare all sources of funding received for the research submitted to the journal, including the name of granting agencies, grant numbers, and a description of each funder's role. (Source: Document 3)\n\nThe Journal of Nature requires that authors disclose all funding sources, including grant numbers, in the acknowledgments section of the manuscript. (Source: Document 4)\n\nSpecific Grant Numbers and Funding Agencies\n\nThe following specific grant numbers and funding agencies were cited in the manuscript's acknowledgments sections:\n\nU.S. National Science Foundation, grant number \n𝐸\n𝐴\n𝑅\n−\n012345\nEAR−012345 (Source: Document 1)\nNational Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health, grant number \n𝑅\n01\n𝐴\n𝐺\n123456\nR01AG123456 (Source: Document 2)\nWellcome Trust, grant numbers \n𝑥\n𝑥\n𝑥\n𝑥\n,\n𝑦\n𝑦\n𝑦\n𝑦\nxxxx,yyyy; Natural Environment Research Council, grant number \n𝑧\n𝑧\n𝑧\n𝑧\nzzzz; and the Economic and Social Research Council, grant number \n𝑎\n𝑎\n𝑎\n𝑎\naaaa (Source: Document 3)\nNational Research Foundation, Grant No. \n987654\n987654; XYZ Medical Foundation, Grant No. \n123987\n123987; and National Science Foundation, Grant No. \n123456\n123456 (Source: Document 6)\nNASA through Hubble Fellowship grant \n𝐻\n𝑆\n𝑇\n−\n𝐻\n𝐹\n−\n01202.01\nHST−HF−01202.01 awarded by the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., for NASA, under the contract \n𝑁\n𝐴\n𝑆\n5\n−\n26555\nNAS5−26555 (Source: Document 7)\nMedical Research Council, grant number \n𝑥\n𝑥\n𝑥\n𝑥\nxxxx (Source: Document 8)\nAmerican Heart Association, grant number \n0655133\n𝐵\n0655133B; and Office of Science, US Department of Energy, Contract No. \n𝑊\n−\n31\n−\n109\n−\n𝐸\n𝑛\n𝑔\n−\n38\nW−31−109−Eng−38 (Source: Document 5)\nU.S. Army Research Office, grant number \n𝑊\n911\n𝑁\n𝐹\n−\n10\n−\n1\n−\n0533\nW911NF−10−1−0533; and the National Key Basic Research Program of China via grant \n2014\n𝐶\n𝐵\n340503\n2014CB340503 (Source: Document 10)\nNICHD center grant to the Population Studies Center at the University of Michigan, specifically \n𝑃\n2\n𝐶\n𝐻\n𝐷\n041028\nP2CHD041028; NIA training grant \n𝑇\n32\n𝐴\n𝐺\n000221\nT32AG000221; and NICHD training grant \n𝑇\n32\n𝐻\n𝐷\n007339\nT32HD007339 (Source: Document 14)\nNational Institutes of Health, grant number formats such as \n𝑅\n01\n𝐺\n𝑀\n987654\nR01GM987654 (Source: Document 16)\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the policies and requirements for acknowledging funding sources in research publications are complex and varied. Funding agencies, journals, and research institutions have specific guidelines for disclosing funding sources, including the use of grant numbers and acknowledgments. It is essential for researchers to understand these requirements to ensure transparency in research funding.\n\nRecommendations\n\nFor specific awards and funding sources acknowledged by the authors, one should:\n\nConsult the specific manuscript in question.\nLook for funding acknowledgments sections in publications.\nCheck grant databases or funding agency websites for award details.\nReferences\nMetadata\nCitations: https://ohiostate.pressbooks.pub/scientificposterguide/chapter/acknowledgements, https://www.nia.nih.gov/research/blog/2024/12/how-acknowledge-nih-funding-research-publications-and-why-it-matters, https://library.bath.ac.uk/c.php?g=721019, https://www.aje.com/arc/editing-tip-writing-acknowledgments, https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/acknowledging-the-difficulties-a-case-study-of-a-funding-text, https://www.journal-publishing.com/blog/acknowledgements-example-academic-research-paper, https://www.ias.edu/sns/publishing, https://www.ukri.org/manage-your-award/publishing-your-research-findings/acknowledging-your-funding, https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/7876/how-to-acknowledge-funding, https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/74917/whats-the-point-in-specifying-the-grant-number-in-a-papers-acknowledgments, https://www.cwauthors.com/article/what-to-include-in-your-acknowledgments-section, https://www.nature.com/nmeth/editorial-policies/acknowledgements, https://research.ufl.edu/compliance/grant-support.html, https://psc.isr.umich.edu/research/funding-acknowledgements, https://solutions.sagepub.com/support/solutions/articles/7000044935-where-can-i-find-information-on-complying-with-funding-body-requirements-, https://grants.nih.gov/policy-and-compliance/policy-topics/federal-funding, https://asiaedit.com/blog/how-to-write-the-acknowledgements-section-of-your-paper, https://academic.oup.com/rev/article/29/4/469/6104367\nSUMMARY\n\nwhat funding sources and grants supported the research mentioned in the manuscript, and what specific awards were acknowledged by the authors?\n\nCarefully reading the provided Document 1, it appears that the document details various policies and requirements for acknowledging funding sources in research publications but does not provide specific information on the funding sources or grants that supported the research mentioned in the query manuscript.

Calibration is essential for interpreting the strain data collected by LIGO, which is used to detect and analyze gravitational waves from astrophysical events.\n\nHere are the key functions of the Newtonian calibrator in LIGO's calibration scheme:\n\n1. **Reference Signal Generation**: The Newtonian calibrator generates a known force or displacement that can be used as a reference signal. This allows the calibration team to establish a relationship between the physical input (the force or displacement) and the output signal from the interferometer.\n\n2. **Measurement of Sensitivity**: By applying a controlled force to the test masses (the mirrors in the interferometer), the Newtonian calibrator helps measure the sensitivity of the interferometer to gravitational waves. This is important for understanding how well LIGO can detect different frequencies and amplitudes of gravitational waves.\n\n3. **Calibration of Transfer Functions**: The data obtained from the Newtonian calibrator can be used to calibrate the transfer functions of the interferometer. This involves determining how the interferometer responds to various inputs, which is critical for accurately interpreting the gravitational wave signals.\n\n4. **Systematic Error Reduction**: The use of a Newtonian calibrator helps identify and reduce systematic errors in the measurement process. By providing a controlled and repeatable calibration method, it ensures that the data collected is reliable and can be compared across different observational runs.\n\n5. **Improving Data Consistency**: Regular calibration using the Newtonian calibrator helps maintain consistency in the data collected over time.

It is designed to apply a time-varying gravitational force on one of the observatory's test masses, inducing a known displacement and changing the differential arm length of the observatory. The NCal system uses a rotor consisting of quadrupole and hexapole mass distributions to apply this time-varying gravitational force. The primary role of the NCal is to provide a cross-check of the existing absolute calibration system, aiming to achieve calibration systematic errors of less than $7\\%$ in magnitude and $4^\\circ$ in phase for the LIGO and Virgo observatories. The NCal allows for a unique measurement of the gravitational constant, $G$, and serves as a direct force absolute reference for the LIGO observatory's strain readout. The NCal system was installed at the X-end of the LIGO Hanford observatory and consists of an aluminum disk with cylindrical cavities cut into it in four-fold and six-fold symmetric patterns. The system was designed to produce forces at twice and three times the rotation frequency, $2f$ and $3f$. The Newtonian Calibrator's measurement of the gravitational constant in the LIGO gravitational wave observatory is subject to limitations and potential systematic errors, which can distort detector data and produce incorrect astrophysical results. The systematic error alone is estimated at levels of $<2\\%$ in magnitude and $<2$ deg in phase. The upper limit on systematic error and associated uncertainty is estimated to be $<7\\%$ in magnitude and $<4$ deg in phase (68% confidence interval) in the most sensitive frequency band $20-2000$ Hz. The photon calibrators (Pcal) are the primary absolute reference used to validate the estimates of $h$ itself as well as the error and uncertainty of the detector response. Systematic errors in calibration parameters lead to systematic errors in the GW strain estimate, and hence to systematic errors in astrophysical parameter estimates in a particular GW signal. The Fisher matrix $\\Gamma$ for a waveform $h(f)$ which depends on parameters $\\theta$ has elements $\\Gamma_{ij} = (\\partial h / \\partial \\theta_j) / (\\partial h / \\partial \\theta_i)$. The Cramér-Rao bound implies that the covariance matrix $\\Sigma$ of these errors is bounded elementwise by the inverse of $\\Gamma$. The Newtonian Calibrator's design and implementation may introduce specific limitations and biases in the measurement process, which can impact the precision of $G$ measurements. A detailed assessment of these factors, including any mathematical formulations, such as $\\Delta G/G = \\delta$, where $\\delta$ represents the fractional error in $G$, is provided in the literature. New tests of Newtonian calibrators (NCal) on the advanced Virgo detector were performed during the LIGO–Virgo observing run O3. The NCal-induced strain on the detector is discussed, with further details available in the literature. A difference of about $3\\%$ is observed between the NCal technique and the reference method of calibration using photon radiation pressure. In conclusion, the Newtonian Calibrator plays a vital role in the calibration scheme of the LIGO gravitational wave observatory, providing a cross-check of the existing absolute calibration system and aiming to achieve high accuracy in calibration systematic errors.

Here are some anticipated outcomes:\n\n1. **Increased Detection Rate**: The upgrades are designed to improve the sensitivity of the detectors, which will lead to a higher detection rate of BNS events. This is particularly important because BNS mergers are relatively rare compared to other types of gravitational wave sources, such as binary black hole mergers. With improved sensitivity, we can expect to detect more events over a given period, potentially increasing the number of observed BNS mergers by an order of magnitude.\n\n2. **Improved Localization**: Enhanced sensitivity and advanced data analysis techniques will allow for better localization of the gravitational wave sources. This means that when a BNS merger is detected, astronomers will be able to pinpoint its location in the sky more accurately. This is crucial for follow-up observations in electromagnetic wavelengths (e.g., gamma-ray bursts, optical counterparts), which can provide additional insights into the physics of these events.\n\n3. **Stronger Constraints on General Relativity**: With a larger sample of BNS detections, researchers will be able to test the predictions of general relativity more rigorously. By analyzing the waveforms of the detected signals, scientists can look for deviations from the expected behavior predicted by general relativity. This could lead to new insights into the nature of gravity, especially in strong-field regimes.\n\n4. **Multi-Messenger Astronomy**: The upgrades will facilitate multi-messenger astronomy, where gravitational wave signals are correlated with electromagnetic signals from the same astrophysical events. This synergy can provide a more comprehensive understanding of phenomena like kilonovae, which are associated with BNS mergers.

With enhanced detection capabilities, improved localization, and more precise tests of general relativity, scientists will be able to gain a deeper understanding of binary neutron star (BNS) mergers and the behavior of neutron stars. The upgraded detectors will enable the detection of a higher rate of BNS mergers, including \n≳\n3\n×\n10\n5\n≳3×10\n5\n binary neutron star mergers in one year of operation. The detection of BNS mergers will provide insights into the underlying equation of state (EOS) of neutron stars, which is essential for understanding the behavior of dense matter. The upgraded detectors will also enable more precise tests of general relativity, including constraints on the neutron star radius and the EOS across the mass range \n1\n−\n1.97\n \nM\n⊙\n1−1.97M\n⊙\n\t​\n\n. The detection of BNS mergers with high signal-to-noise ratios by upgraded detectors will enable the study of post-merger phenomena in greater detail. The upgraded detectors' enhanced sensitivity and improved low-frequency response are expected to enable more precise measurements of binary neutron star merger properties, including luminosity distance and inclination. This improvement will have significant implications for multi-messenger astronomy and astrophysical studies. The expected improvements in characterizing the astrophysical properties of binary neutron star mergers, such as merger rates, mass distribution, and spin properties, with the upgraded detectors, include: 1. Increased detections: Upgraded detectors are anticipated to yield around \n10\n–\n200\n10–200 detections of BNS mergers per year of operation at design sensitivity. 2. Improved parameter estimation: There will be improved estimates of binary properties, including component masses, spins, and tidal parameters. 3. Constraining the equation of state: The increased sensitivity will enable techniques to constrain the equation of state at supranuclear densities, which governs matter inside neutron stars. 4. Discovery of thousands of BNS mergers: Future GW detector networks will have the potential to discover thousands of BNS mergers. 5. More accurate astrophysical parameter constraints: The next generation of GW interferometers will enable more accurate constraints on several astrophysical parameters describing binary evolution, including merger rates, mass distribution, and spin properties.\n\nThe new generation detectors will improve localization precision, with median reductions in the size of the \n90\n%\n90% credible sky region of \n30\n%\n30% compared to current methods. They will provide accurate localization even before the merger, and detailed information on luminosity distance, inclination, and masses, which can be used to prioritize expensive telescope time. The CE4020ET network offers robust classification for BNS and BBH mergers. Even networks such as HLVK+ are capable of supporting a confident classification between BBH and BNS sources.\n\nThe interplay with other channels of information promises substantial scientific rewards regarding the aftermath of BNS mergers. The increased sensitivity of current and future GW detectors is expected to lead to more frequent detection of BNS mergers and other exotic systems. The detection of binary neutron star mergers with high signal-to-noise ratios by upgraded detectors will enable the study of post-merger phenomena in greater detail. According to a study by S Haque, published in 2024, significant changes in post-merger gravitational wave analysis are expected if quark matter appears at low densities. The upgraded detectors will provide more accurate measurements of the tidal deformability and other astrophysical properties of neutron stars.\n\nReferences\n\n[1] https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/527/4/11575/7472106 [2] https://arxiv.org/html/2507.07895v1 [3] https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08593-z [4] https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.108.122006 [5] https://arxiv.org/html/2401.02604v1 [6] https://arxiv.org/html/2507.20258v1 [7] https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/astronomy-and-space-sciences/articles/10.3389/fspas.2020.609460/full [8] https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.03632 [9] https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08593-z [10] https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ac98fe/pdf [11] https://archive.int.washington.edu/proposal/sciPDF_np_mergers.pdf [12] https://arxiv.org/html/2507.20258v1 [13] https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021GReGr..53...59S/abstract </TASK_OUTPUT>\n\nREFERENCES\n\n<TASK_OUTPUT>\n\nhttps://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/h6rl-mcjm\nhttps://astrobites.org/2024/04/20/source-needed-could-signal-confusion-hurt-next-gen-gravitational-wave-detectors/\nhttps://arxiv.org/html/2401.02604v1\nhttps://inspirehep.net/literature/1944901\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.108.122006\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08593-z\nhttps://arxiv.org/html/2507.07895v1\nhttps://arxiv.org/html/2409.05068v1\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.109.103035\nhttps://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/acfcb1\nhttps://arxiv.org/html/2503.23413v1\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04750-w\nhttps://arxiv.org/html/2509.12246v1\nhttps://arxiv.org/html/2505.11033v1\nhttps://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ac5f04\nhttps://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7242351\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.107.044020.pdf\nhttps://www.arxiv.org/pdf/1410.5882.pdf\nhttps://www.arxiv.org/pdf/1807.02133.pdf\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevX.9.011001.pdf\nhttps://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2022/09/aa43705-22/aa43705-22.html\nhttps://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2025/05/aa52863-24/aa52863-24.html\nhttps://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/acfcb1\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/23cf-j34y\nhttps://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/527/4/11575/7472106\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2201.03632.pdf\nhttps://www.frontiersin.org/journals/astronomy-and-space-sciences/articles/10.3389/fspas.2020.609460/full\nhttps://archive.int.washington.edu/proposal/sciPDF_np_mergers.pdf\nhttps://arxiv.org/html/2507.20258v1\nhttp://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021GReGr..53...59S/abstract\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.98.043002.pdf\nhttps://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6382/ad828a\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.109.103035\nhttps://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ac089a\nhttps://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjc/s10052-025-14673-1\nhttps://arxiv.org/html/2505.05241v3\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.110.063018\nhttps://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2018/08/aa33071-18/aa33071-18.html\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevX.15.021014\nhttps://repository.lsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2106&context=physics_astronomy_pubs\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s42005-021-00526-2\nhttps://arxiv.org/html/2401.02604v1\nhttps://arxiv.org/html/2507.07895v1\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08593-z\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.108.122006\nhttps://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/527/4/11575/7472106 </TASK_OUTPUT>", "marvel_deepsearch_score": 10, "evaluation_model_type": "openai", "evaluation_model_name": "gpt-4o-mini", "qa_model_type": "openai", "qa_model_name": "gpt-4o-mini", "gpt4o_mini_answer_relevancy": 0.98, "gpt4o_mini_answer_correctness": 0.98, "gpt4o_mini_faithfulness": 0.82, "marvel_standard_answer_relevancy": 0.92, "marvel_standard_answer_correctness": 0.87, "marvel_standard_faithfulness": 0.87, "marvel_deepsearch_answer_relevancy": 0.95, "marvel_deepsearch_answer_correctness": 0.92, "marvel_deepsearch_faithfulness": 0.85}

This finding is detailed in the article available at https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.117.061101.\n\nKey Findings\n\nThe key findings of Bird et al.'s 2016 research on the coalescence of primordial black holes (PBHs) as an explanation for the observed gravitational-wave event GW150914, as published in Physical Review Letters, are as follows:\n\nExplanation for GW150914: The research suggested that the gravitational-wave event GW150914, detected by the LIGO detectors, can be explained by the coalescence of primordial black holes.\n\nMerger Rate Compatibility: If PBHs were the dominant component of dark matter, the expected PBH merger rate would exceed the rate estimated by the LIGO Scientific Collaboration and Virgo Collaboration. However, if PBHs constitute a fraction of dark matter, the merger rate can be made compatible.\n\nAbundance of PBHs: The abundance of PBHs required to explain the suggested lower bound on the event rate (> 2 events Gpc^{-3} yr^{-1}) roughly coincides with the existing upper limit set by the nondetection of the cosmic microwave background spectral distortion.\n\nTesting the PBH Scenario: This implies that the proposed PBH scenario may be tested in the not-too-distant future.\n\nMasses of Black Holes: The source, GW150914, was produced by a nearly equal mass binary black hole of masses \n3\n6\n−\n4\n+\n5\n𝑀\n⊙\n36\n−4\n+5\n\t​\n\nM\n⊙\n\t​\n\n and \n2\n9\n−\n4\n+\n4\n𝑀\n⊙\n29\n−4\n+4\n\t​\n\nM\n⊙\n\t​\n\n.\n\nSpin and Merger: The dimensionless spin magnitude of the more massive black hole is bound to be < 0.7 (at 90% probability). The binary merges into a black hole of mass \n6\n2\n−\n4\n+\n4\n𝑀\n⊙\n62\n−4\n+4\n\t​\n\nM\n⊙\n\t​\n\n and spin \n0.6\n7\n−\n0.07\n+\n0.05\n0.67\n−0.07\n+0.05\n\t​\n\n.\n\nThe research was published in Physical Review Letters with the reference Phys.

The paper is available on arXiv with the identifier arXiv:1603.08338.\n\nAdditional Research Findings\n\nFurthermore, Bird et al. investigated the origin of the magnetic-field-independent \n−\n∣\n𝐴\n∣\n𝑇\n1\n/\n2\n−∣A∣T\n1/2\n term observed in the low-temperature resistivity of several materials.

However, if PBHs constitute a fraction of dark matter, the merger rate can be made compatible.\n\nMerger Rate Constraints: The event rates of mergers of PBH binaries (Gpc\n−\n3\n−3\n yr\n−\n1\n−1\n) are less than \n0.002\n0.002 for \n𝑀\n𝑝\n𝑏\nℎ\n=\n30\n𝑀\n⊙\nM\npbh\n\t​\n\n=30M\n⊙\n\t​\n\n, \n5\n5 for \n𝑀\n𝑝\n𝑏\nℎ\n=\n10\n𝑀\n⊙\nM\npbh\n\t​\n\n=10M\n⊙\n\t​\n\n, and \n2000\n2000 for \n𝑀\n𝑝\n𝑏\nℎ\nM\npbh\n\t​\n\n.\n\nFraction of Dark Matter: The research indicated that only a small fraction of dark matter can be made of PBHs, with a constraint of \n𝑓\n𝑃\n𝐵\n𝐻\n≲\n0.01\nf\nPBH\n\t​\n\n≲0.01 for PBHs masses between 1 and 300 \n𝑀\n⊙\nM\n⊙\n\t​\n\n.\n\nMass Function: The study used a monochromatic mass function for PBHs and found that the abundance of PBHs required to explain the suggested lower bound on the event rate roughly coincides with the existing upper limit set by the nondetection of the cosmic microwave background spectral distortion.\n\nImplications for Dark Matter Understanding\n\nThe implications of Bird et al.'s 2016 research on our understanding of dark matter are significant. The study proposed that primordial black holes could be a component of dark matter, and further studies, such as more data from LIGO or analysis of the cosmic microwave background, could test this hypothesis. The research also highlighted the possibility that dark matter composed of \n∼\n30\n𝑀\n⊙\n∼30M\n⊙\n\t​\n\n PBHs could explain the merger event rates observed by LIGO.\n\nPrimordial Black Holes as Dark Matter Candidates\n\nBird et al.'s research suggested that primordial black holes could be a viable candidate for dark matter, with a proposed mass range that could explain some of the observed dark matter properties. The study implied that PBHs in certain mass ranges (e.g., around \n10\n17\n≤\n𝑀\n𝑃\n𝐵\n𝐻\n≤\n10\n22\n10\n17\n≤M\nPBH\n\t​\n\n≤10\n22\n g for scale-invariant perturbations) could constitute a significant portion of dark matter.\n\nSupplementary Information and Tests of General Relativity\n\nThe research conducted by Bird et al. in 2016 also includes supplementary files providing information on detector status, source parameters, and tests of general relativity. This additional information is available at https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett/118.221101.\n\nAdditional Implications\n\nThe implications of Bird et al.'s 2016 research on the broader understanding of dark matter and the universe are significant. The study suggests that PBHs could be a component of dark matter, and their merger rate can be tested by future LIGO observations. This idea has been explored in other works, such as Ballesteros and Taoso (2018) and Bird et al. (2023).\n\nThe research also notes that uncertainties in the rate of PBH mergers arise from imprecise knowledge of the phase-space structure of galactic halos on small scales, with estimates spanning a range that overlaps the \n2\n−\n53\n \nG\np\nc\n−\n3\n \ny\nr\n−\n1\n2−53Gpc\n−3\nyr\n−1\n rate estimated from GW150914. The authors suggest that PBH mergers would be distributed spatially like dark matter, lacking optical and neutrino counterparts.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, Bird et al.'s 2016 research had significant implications for the broader understanding of dark matter and the universe, beyond the specific case of GW150914. The study suggests that PBHs could be a component of dark matter, and their merger rate can be tested by future LIGO observations. The research has contributed to a larger wave of interest in PBH dark matter, with the number of papers written on PBHs rising to \n∼\n300\n∼300 per year.\n\nReferences\nBird, S., et al. (2016).

In the context of astrophysical observations, particularly in the search for pulsars or other periodic signals, non-Gaussian noise can lead to misleading results, such as false positives or the misidentification of signal characteristics.\n\nWhen analyzing J1833-1034, researchers may have found that the noise characteristics deviated from the expected Gaussian distribution, which is often assumed in signal processing. This non-Gaussian noise could arise from various sources, such as instrumental effects, environmental factors, or intrinsic astrophysical phenomena. The presence of such noise complicates the statistical analysis, as traditional methods that rely on Gaussian assumptions may not be valid.\n\nThe implications of this analysis are significant:\n\n1. **Signal Detection**: Non-Gaussian noise can obscure weak signals, making them harder to detect. This necessitates the development of more robust detection algorithms that can account for non-standard noise distributions.\n\n2. **False Positives**: The likelihood of false positives increases in the presence of non-Gaussian noise, as random fluctuations may mimic the characteristics of a genuine signal. This can lead to erroneous conclusions about the presence of pulsars or other astrophysical sources.\n\n3. **Characterization of Signals**: If the noise is not properly accounted for, the parameters derived from the detected signals (such as period, amplitude, and spectral characteristics) may be inaccurate, leading to a misunderstanding of the source's nature.\n\n4. **Statistical Methods**: The analysis highlights the need for advanced statistical techniques that can handle non-Gaussian noise, such as Bayesian methods or machine learning approaches, which can provide more reliable results in the presence of complex noise environments.\n\nIn summary, the analysis of J1833-1034 underscores the importance of recognizing and addressing non-Gaussian noise in narrow-band searches to improve the accuracy and reliability of astrophysical signal detection and characterization.", "gpt4o_mini_score": 9, "marvel_standard_answer": "<QUERY> What does the analysis of the outlier j1833-1034 suggest regarding the presence of non-gaussian noise in the narrow-band search? </QUERY>\n\nAfter carefully reading the provided <TEXT> from various documents, I will perform a needle-in-a-haystack search to find the answer to the query.\n\n**Document2** states that \"there is no indication of non-Gaussian noise in the narrow-band search, as no significant outlier was produced for J1833-1034 or Vela;\" This is supported by **Document5**, which also mentions that \"the analysis does not suggest the presence of non-Gaussian noise in the narrow-band search for this source.\"\n\nOn the other hand, **Document3** suggests that the outlier J1833-1034 \"may be related to non-Gaussian noise in the narrow-band search\" and that \"the analyzed bands seem similarly polluted by non-Gaussian contributions which produce peaks in the detection statistic.\"\n\n**Document1** and **Document4** mention that the analysis of J1833-1034 revealed promising features during basic follow-up steps, with no known noise line identified.\n\nConsidering the information from the documents, there are competing answers:\n\n* Some documents (**Document2** and **Document5**) suggest that there is no indication of non-Gaussian noise in the narrow-band search for J1833-1034.\n* One document (**Document3**) suggests that the outlier may be related to non-Gaussian noise.\n\nSince there are no exact dates provided for the documents, I will use majority voting to pick the most relevant answer.

According to a study published in [Physical Review D](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.96.122006), the analysis of J1833-1034 revealed promising features during basic follow-up steps, with no known noise line identified.\n\nIn a related study, [LIGO-P1700221](https://dcc.ligo.org/LIGO-P1700221/public) presented an analysis of J1833-1034, which suggested that there is no indication of non-Gaussian noise in the narrow-band search. This conclusion was based on the histograms of the Detection Statistic (DS) obtained in the narrow-band search, as shown in Fig.8. The study found no significant outlier for J1833-1034 or Vela.\n\nHowever, another study published in [West Virginia University Research Repository](https://researchrepository.wvu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2012&context=faculty_publications) presented a more nuanced view. The analysis suggested that the outlier J1833-1034 may be related to non-Gaussian noise in the narrow-band search. The study found that the outlier is not a clear peak present in the analysis, surrounded by several lower peaks in the detection statistic which are not above the corresponding p-value threshold.\n\nFurther analysis using two targeted search pipelines found that the outliers have a higher resulting p-value with respect to the 1% threshold used in the initial outlier selection. This increased the likelihood that these outliers were generated from noise. Additionally, a study on [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Top-panel-SNR-computed-with-respect-to-the-fraction-of-data-for-J1833-1034-outlier-in_fig3_320279863) plotted the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) computed with respect to the fraction of data for the J1833-1034 outlier.\n\nAnother [ResearchGate study](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/alues-of-the-local-maximum-of-the-DS-over-the-spin-down-corrections-and-the-frequency_fig4_320279863) found that using a particular method, the contribution of non-Gaussian noise in the DS is retained while removing a possible signal.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe analysis of the outlier J1833-1034 presents a complex picture regarding the presence of non-Gaussian noise in narrow-band searches. While some studies suggest that there is no indication of non-Gaussian noise, others propose that the outlier may be related to such noise.

Each term represents a specific property: photocurrent ($I_{ph}$), responsivity ($S$), optical power ($P$), quantum efficiency ($\\eta$), electron charge ($e$), and photon energy ($h\\nu$).\n\n<ANSWER> The relationship expressed in the equation for the photocurrent is given by $I_{ph} = S \\cdot P = \\eta \\cdot e \\cdot h \\nu \\cdot P$, where $I_{ph}$ is the photocurrent, $S$ is the responsivity, $P$ is the optical power, $\\eta$ is the quantum efficiency, $e$ is the electron charge, and $h \\nu$ is the photon energy. This equation signifies that the photocurrent is directly proportional to the optical power and is influenced by the quantum efficiency of the material and the energy of the incident photons. <https://www.rp-photonics.com/photocurrent.html> </ANSWER>\n\n# Relationship Between Photocurrent, Light Intensity, and Frequency\nThe photocurrent is a crucial parameter for a photodetector under varying illumination intensities and applied bias potentials. It is estimated by the equation $I_{ph} = I_{light} - I_{dark}$, where $I_{light}$ and $I_{dark}$ represent the current in the presence of incident light and dark current, respectively [1].\n\n## Photocurrent and Light Intensity Relationship\nThe relationship between the photocurrent and light power can be expressed as $I_{ph} = CP^{\\gamma}$, where $C$ and $\\gamma$ are the device-dependent constants and the index of [2]. The photocurrent is directly proportional to the intensity of the light, as it depends on the number of photons striking the surface, not their energy. This can be expressed as $I_{ph} \\alpha Intensity$ [3].\n\n## Photocurrent and Frequency Relationship\nThe energy of the photons, which is related to their frequency $f$ by $E = hf$, where $h$ is Planck's constant, affects the kinetic energy of the emitted electrons and the stopping voltage, but not the number of electrons emitted, and hence not the photocurrent [4]. The maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectrons is given by $K_{max}=hf−\\phi$, where $K_{max}$ is the maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectrons, $h$ is Planck's constant, $f$ is the frequency of the incident radiation, and $\\phi$ is the work function of the metal [5].\n\n## Photocurrent Equation\nThe photocurrent $I_{ph}$ is also expressed as $I_{ph} = q \\eta A \\Phi e_g$ (Eq. (3)), indicating its proportionality to the incident radiant power, with $q$ being a constant, $\\eta$ likely representing efficiency, $A$ possibly denoting area, and $\\Phi e_g$ signifying the incident radiant power [1]. The responsivity $S$ is the proportionality factor between the photocurrent and the optical power, given by $I = S \\cdot P = \\eta \\cdot e \\cdot h \\nu \\cdot P$, where $I$ is the photocurrent, $S$ is the responsivity, $P$ is the optical power, $\\eta$ is the quantum efficiency, $e$ is the electron charge, and $h \\nu$ is the photon energy [6].\n\n## Conclusion\nIn conclusion, the photocurrent is directly proportional to the intensity of the light and is related to the frequency of the light through the energy of the photons. The relationships between photocurrent, light intensity, and frequency are crucial in understanding the photoelectric effect and its applications.\n\n## References\n[1] [https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/photocurrent](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/photocurrent)\n[2] [https://www.researchgate.net/figure/The-measured-photocurrent-as-a-function-of-light-power-intensity-which-can-be-well_fig3_319012386](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/The-measured-photocurrent-as-a-function-of-light-power-intensity-which-can-be-well_fig3_319012386)\n[3] [https://juddy.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Notes-4.2.1.pdf](https://juddy.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Notes-4.2.1.pdf)\n[4] [https://www.physicsforums.com/threads/relationship-among-intensity-frequency-and-current.860609/](https://www.physicsforums.com/threads/relationship-among-intensity-frequency-and-current.860609/)\n[5] [https://phys.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/University_Physics/University_Physics_(OpenStax)/University_Physics_III_-_Optics_and_Modern_Physics_(OpenStax)/06%3A_Photons_and_Matter_Waves/6.03%3A_Photoelectric_Effect](https://phys.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/University_Physics/University_Physics_(OpenStax)/University_Physics_III_-_Optics_and_Modern_Physics_(OpenStax)/06%3A_Photons_and_Matter_Waves/6.03%3A_Photoelectric_Effect)\n[6] [https://www.rp-photonics.com/photocurrent.html](https://www.rp-photonics.com/photocurrent.html)", "marvel_standard_score": 8, "marvel_deepsearch_answer": "Step 1: Understand the Query\n\nThe query asks for the relationship expressed in the equation for the photocurrent and the representation of each term in the equation.\n\n2: Review the Documents\n\nMultiple documents provide various equations related to photocurrent.

This result is consistent with the analysis of quasinormal mode ringdown fields.", "gpt4o_mini_answer": "The relationship between the decay rate of a scalar field measured at the horizon of a black hole and the size of the black hole is closely tied to the properties of quasinormal modes (QNMs). Quasinormal modes are the characteristic oscillations of black holes that occur after a perturbation, such as the collapse of matter or the merging of two black holes. These modes are defined by complex frequencies, which consist of a real part (related to the oscillation frequency) and an imaginary part (related to the decay rate).\n\n1. **Decay Rate and Black Hole Size**: The decay rate of a scalar field, which can be thought of as the rate at which perturbations dissipate, is influenced by the mass (and thus the size) of the black hole. For a Schwarzschild black hole, the decay rates of the QNMs are inversely related to the mass of the black hole. Specifically, as the mass of the black hole increases, the imaginary part of the quasinormal mode frequencies (which corresponds to the decay rate) tends to decrease. This means that larger black holes have longer-lived oscillations, while smaller black holes have faster decay rates.\n\n2. **Quasinormal Modes**: The quasinormal modes of a black hole can be understood as solutions to the linearized equations of motion for perturbations around the black hole's background. For a scalar field, these modes can be computed using techniques such as the WKB approximation or numerical methods. The frequencies of these modes depend on the black hole's parameters, including its mass, charge, and angular momentum.\n\n3. **Physical Interpretation**: The decay of the scalar field at the horizon can be interpreted in terms of the black hole's ability to absorb energy and information. The faster decay rates for smaller black holes suggest that they are more efficient at dissipating perturbations, while larger black holes can sustain oscillations for longer periods. This has implications for the stability of the black hole and the information that can be extracted from it.\n\nIn summary, the decay rate of a scalar field at the horizon is inversely related to the size of the black hole, with larger black holes exhibiting slower decay rates in their quasinormal modes. This relationship highlights the intricate connection between black hole properties and the dynamics of fields in their vicinity, particularly in the context of gravitational wave astronomy and the study of black hole mergers.", "gpt4o_mini_score": 9, "marvel_standard_answer": "The relationship between the decay rate of a scalar field measured at the horizon and the size of a black hole is fundamentally tied to the quasinormal mode ringdown fields.

The scattering of light can occur due to various factors, including imperfections in the optics, thermal noise, and seismic vibrations. Slow scattering rates typically refer to lower rates of light scattering events, which can be associated with more stable conditions, while fast scattering rates indicate a higher frequency of scattering events, often linked to more turbulent or unstable conditions.\n\n2. **Ground Motion Frequencies**: Ground motion, or seismic noise, affects the stability of the LIGO detectors. This noise can be categorized into different frequency bands, with low-frequency noise (below 10 Hz) often dominated by seismic activity, while higher frequencies (above 10 Hz) may be influenced by other factors such as thermal noise or quantum noise.\n\n3. **Correlations**:\n   - **Low Frequencies and Slow Scattering**: At low frequencies, the ground motion is typically slower and more stable, which can lead to a lower rate of scattering events. This stability allows for more precise measurements of gravitational waves, as the detector is less affected by rapid fluctuations in the environment.\n   - **High Frequencies and Fast Scattering**: Conversely, at higher frequencies, ground motion can be more erratic, leading to increased scattering rates. This can introduce noise into the measurements, making it more challenging to detect gravitational waves. The increased scattering can also lead to fluctuations in the light intensity reaching the photodetectors, further complicating the signal extraction process.\n\n4. **Impact on Sensitivity**: The sensitivity of LIGO to gravitational waves is affected by these correlations. Ideally, a lower scattering rate at low frequencies allows for better sensitivity to gravitational wave signals, while higher scattering rates at high frequencies can mask these signals, reducing the overall detection capability.\n\nIn summary, the relationship between slow and fast scattering rates and ground motion frequencies in LIGO detectors is crucial for understanding how environmental factors influence gravitational wave detection. Lower scattering rates at low frequencies are generally favorable for sensitivity, while higher scattering rates at high frequencies can introduce noise that complicates the detection of gravitational waves.", "gpt4o_mini_score": 6, "marvel_standard_answer": "<QUERY> What are the correlations between slow and fast scattering rates and ground motion frequencies as observed in LIGO detectors? </QUERY>\n\n## Step 1: Understand the Query\nThe query asks for the correlations between slow and fast scattering rates and ground motion frequencies as observed in LIGO detectors.\n\n## Step 2: Read and Analyze the Documents\nAfter reviewing the provided documents, it is evident that multiple documents discuss the correlations between slow and fast scattering rates and ground motion frequencies in LIGO detectors.\n\n## Step 3: Identify Relevant Information\n- **Slow Scattering**: Typically associated with ground motion in the microseism band ($0.1–0.3\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$) and sometimes in the $0.1–0.5\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$ band.

These correlations are crucial in understanding the noise sources that affect the sensitivity of the detectors.\n\n## Observations of Slow and Fast Scattering\n\nDuring the third observing run (O3), two populations of scattering transient noise were observed - Slow Scattering and Fast Scattering [1]. Slow scattering triggers refer to long-duration arches visible in time-frequency spectrograms during high ground motion in the microseism band (0.1 - 0.3 Hz), affecting gravitational wave strain sensitivity in the 20 - 120 Hz band. Fast scattering triggers are correlated with ground motion activity in the 1 to 6 Hz band, with higher peak frequency, lower SNR, and lower duration, and are more frequent at LIGO Livingston (LLO) than at LIGO Hanford (LHO) [2].\n\n## Causes of Slow and Fast Scattering\n\nSlow scattering is caused by ground motion in the microseism band (0.1 - 0.5 Hz) [3] and tends to occur when ground motion is high in the earthquake (0.03 - 0.1 Hz) or microseism (0.1 - 0.5 Hz) frequency bands [4]. Fast scattering, on the other hand, is correlated with ground motion in the microseism (0.1 - 0.3 Hz) and anthropogenic (1 - 6 Hz) bands [2].\n\n## Noise Coupling Mechanisms\n\nThe slow scattering noise coupling mechanism involves relative motion between the end test mass (ETM) and the annular end reaction mass (AERM), with a scattered light path involving multiple reflections between the test mass and the scatterer [2]. The relative movement between the ETM and AERM, $\\delta x_{sc}$, is approximated by the motion sensed at the penultimate (PUM) stage of the compound pendulum.\n\n## Data Analysis and Results\n\nThe data used for these analyses is publicly available in the Gravitational Wave Open Science Center (GWOSC) [5]. The correlations between slow and fast scattering rates and ground motion frequencies can be further studied by analyzing the noise sources and their coupling mechanisms [6]. The noise budget plots for the gravitational wave channels of the two LIGO detectors show that the sensitivity is limited by various noise sources, including quantum noise, thermal noise, and gas noise [7].\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the correlations between slow and fast scattering rates and ground motion frequencies in LIGO detectors are complex and involve various noise coupling mechanisms. Understanding these correlations is essential to improve the sensitivity of the detectors and enhance the detection of gravitational waves.\n\n## References\n\n[1] [https://arxiv.org/html/2409.02831v2](https://arxiv.org/html/2409.02831v2)\n[2] [https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/142167/2101.11673.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y](https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/142167/2101.11673.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y)\n[3] [https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevX.13.041039](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevX.13.041039)\n[4] [https://pure.mpg.de/rest/items/item_3612424_4/component/file_3649562/content](https://pure.mpg.de/rest/items/item_3612424_4/component/file_3649562/content)\n[5] [https://www.gwosc.org/](https://www.gwosc.org/)\n[6] [https://dcc.ligo.org/LIGO-P1500260/public](https://dcc.ligo.org/LIGO-P1500260/public)\n[7] [https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/system/media_files/binaries/700/original/2020.pdf?1631125663](https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/system/media_files/binaries/700/original/2020.pdf?1631125663)", "marvel_standard_score": 9, "marvel_deepsearch_answer": "The correlations between slow and fast scattering rates and ground motion frequencies as observed in LIGO detectors indicate that slow scattering is primarily associated with ground motion in the microseism band (\n0.1\n–\n0.3\n \nH\nz\n0.1–0.3Hz or \n0.1\n–\n0.5\n \nH\nz\n0.1–0.5Hz), affecting the \n20\n–\n120\n \nH\nz\n20–120Hz band of gravitational wave strain sensitivity.

The different formation models—such as isolated binary evolution, dynamical formation in dense stellar environments, and the formation of binaries through the merger of massive stars—offer insights into the life cycles of stars and the conditions necessary for the formation of these compact objects. Tension among models indicates that our understanding of stellar evolution and the environments in which these binaries form may be incomplete.\n\n2. **Population Characteristics**: The observed properties of the compact-binary mergers, such as their mass distributions, merger rates, and spins, can be used to test and constrain different formation models. For instance, if the observed mass distribution of BBHs is skewed towards higher masses, this may favor certain formation channels over others. Discrepancies between model predictions and observations can lead to revisions in our understanding of the underlying astrophysical processes.\n\n3. **Implications for Gravitational Wave Astronomy**: The detection of gravitational waves from compact-binary mergers provides a new way to study the universe. The tension among formation models can affect predictions for future observations, including the expected rates of mergers and the characteristics of the events. Understanding these tensions helps refine models, which in turn improves the interpretation of gravitational wave signals and the astrophysical implications drawn from them.\n\n4. **Cosmological Insights**: The formation models also have implications for the broader cosmological context, including the evolution of galaxies and the distribution of matter in the universe. For example, if certain models suggest that most BBHs form in dense stellar clusters, this could inform our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution.\n\n5. **Future Research Directions**: The existing tensions highlight areas where further research is needed. They can guide observational strategies for future gravitational wave detections and electromagnetic follow-ups, as well as motivate theoretical work to develop more comprehensive models that can account for the observed data.\n\nIn summary, the significance of the tension among various proposed formation models lies in its potential to enhance our understanding of stellar evolution, refine our interpretations of gravitational wave data, and inform future research directions in astrophysics.

A crucial requirement of this run was the rapid identification and public reporting of compact binary mergers, enabling massive follow-up observation campaigns with electromagnetic and neutrino observatories.\n\n## Context and Background\n\nThe growing catalog of compact binary mergers observed during the third observing run is enabling the exploration of formation and evolutionary pathways of these objects. However, there is tension among various proposed formation models. The possible formation histories of neutron star binaries, for instance, remain unresolved by current gravitational-wave catalogs.\n\n## Significance of Tension among Formation Models\n\nThe significance of tension among various proposed formation models in the context of compact-binary mergers observed during the third observing run of advanced LIGO and Virgo is being studied. This tension is particularly relevant when considering the detection of compact-binary mergers, which presents an unprecedented view of the properties of black holes and neutron stars.\n\n## Findings from the Third Observing Run\n\nThe third Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC-3) describes signals detected with Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo up to the end of their third observing run. Specifically, GWTC-3 presents candidate gravitational waves from compact binary coalescences during the second half of the third observing run (O3b). These observations include the first confident observations of neutron-star-black-hole binaries.\n\n## Constraining Formation Models\n\nThe detection of an eccentric binary system could be vital in constraining compact binary formation models. A search for aligned spin eccentric neutron star-black hole binaries (NSBH) and aligned-spin eccentric binary neutron star (BNS) systems was conducted using data from the third observing run.

The observations from the third observing run have enabled the exploration of these pathways, revealing tensions among various proposed formation models, particularly in the context of neutron star binaries and black hole-neutron star binaries. These tensions highlight the need for further investigation into the properties of black holes and neutron stars.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe third observing run of Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo, which took place between April 2019 and March 2020, resulted in the detection of dozens of gravitational-wave candidates, many of which are now published as confident detections. A crucial requirement of this run was the rapid identification and public reporting of compact binary mergers, enabling massive follow-up observation campaigns with electromagnetic and neutrino observatories.\n\nContext and Background\n\nThe growing catalog of compact binary mergers observed during the third observing run is enabling the exploration of formation and evolutionary pathways of these objects. However, there is tension among various proposed formation models. The possible formation histories of neutron star binaries, for instance, remain unresolved by current gravitational-wave catalogs.\n\nThe significance of tension among various proposed formation models in the context of compact-binary mergers observed during the third observing run of advanced LIGO and Virgo is being studied. This tension is particularly relevant when considering the detection of compact-binary mergers, which presents an unprecedented view of the properties of black holes and neutron stars.\n\nFindings from the Third Observing Run\n\nThe third Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC-3) describes signals detected with Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo up to the end of their third observing run. Specifically, GWTC-3 presents candidate gravitational waves from compact binary coalescences during the second half of the third observing run (O3b). These observations include the first confident observations of neutron-star-black-hole binaries.\n\nThe detection of an eccentric binary system could be vital in constraining compact binary formation models. A search for aligned spin eccentric neutron star-black hole binaries (NSBH) and aligned-spin eccentric binary neutron star (BNS) systems was conducted using data from the third observing run. No new statistically significant candidates were found, and the local merger rate was constrained for binary neutron stars and neutron star-black hole binaries.\n\nObservational Signatures\n\nThe observational signatures that can help distinguish between different formation models for compact-binary mergers observed during the third observing run of advanced LIGO and Virgo include the combined distribution of \nm\nc\nh\ni\nr\np\nm\nchirp\n\t​\n\n, \n𝜒\ne\nf\nf\nχ\neff\n\t​\n\n, and \n𝑧\nm\ne\nr\ng\ne\nr\nz\nmerger\n\t​\n\n.

[4]\n\nImplications of RPSD on Binary Systems in Stellar Clusters\n\nThe implications of the derived criterion for significant eccentricity oscillation and relativistic phase space diffusion (RPSD) on the long-term behavior of binary systems in stellar clusters are multifaceted:\n\nRPSD Phenomenon: RPSD occurs in binary systems in stellar clusters when the relativistic precession timescale \n𝑡\nm\ni\nn\nt\nmin\n\t​\n\n is less than or comparable to the outer orbital period \n𝑇\n𝜙\nT\nϕ\n\t​\n\n. This causes abrupt shifts in the binary's approximate DA integrals of motion.\n\nEffect on Merger Timescale: RPSD may affect the merger timescale of compact object binaries in stellar clusters, potentially accelerating mergers.\n\nEccentricity Oscillations: RPSD drives a \"diffusion\" of the DA Hamiltonian, which is an approximate integral of motion. This diffusion does not follow simple statistical behavior and does not obey a diffusion equation.\n\nInclination Window: The criteria for producing significant RPSD involve the inclination \n𝑖\n0\ni\n0\n\t​\n\n and the ratio \n2\n𝑡\nm\ni\nn\n/\n𝑇\n𝜙\n2t\nmin\n\t​\n\n/T\nϕ\n\t​\n\n.

In cusped clusters, many binaries can reach high eccentricity, whereas in cored clusters, few binaries can reach high eccentricity.\n\nImpact on Secular Evolution: RPSD can change the subsequent secular evolution dramatically, even in hierarchical triples. The effect depends critically on GR precession and happens rapidly, unlike the gradual accumulation of fluctuations over many secular periods.\n\nNumerical Accuracy: The numerical accuracy of SA integrations becomes expensive in the presence of RPSD, requiring tiny timesteps to get robust results over many secular periods.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe derived criterion for significant eccentricity oscillation and relativistic phase space diffusion (RPSD) in binary systems is a complex phenomenon that has been studied extensively.

The Pauli-Lubanski spin vector is essential for classifying irreducible representations of the Poincaré group and understanding spin properties in relativistic contexts. The Pauli-Lubanski vector and the helicity operator are related but distinct concepts, with the former being a four-vector that describes the spin properties of relativistic particles, and the latter being a scalar operator that describes the projection of the spin onto the momentum vector. The key differences between the Pauli-Lubanski spin vector and the helicity operator are: * The Pauli-Lubanski vector is a four-vector that describes the spin properties of relativistic particles, while the helicity operator is a scalar operator that describes the projection of the spin onto the momentum vector. * The Pauli-Lubanski vector is a more general concept that applies to both massive and massless particles, while the helicity operator is specifically defined for massless particles. The Pauli-Lubanski spin vector plays a crucial role in the representation theory of the Poincaré group, particularly in classifying irreducible representations of the group. The irreducible representations of the Poincaré group come in three classes corresponding to the momentum four-vector being time-like, light-like, and space-like. For massive particles, the little group is \n𝑆\n𝑂\n(\n3\n)\nSO(3) or \n𝑆\n𝑈\n(\n2\n)\nSU(2), and the irreducible representations are labeled by the spin \n𝑗\nj. For massless particles, the little group is \n𝑆\n𝑂\n(\n2\n)\nSO(2) or \n𝑈\n(\n1\n)\nU(1), and the representations are labeled by the helicity \n𝜆\nλ. The Pauli-Lubanski vector is related to the spin and orbital angular momenta in quantum field theory (QFT). In the rest frame, its spatial components coincide with the angular momentum, i.e., the spin. The square of the Pauli-Lubanski vector, \n𝑊\n2\nW\n2\n, is a Casimir operator that commutes with all generators of the Poincaré group and has the form \n𝑊\n2\n=\n𝑚\n2\n𝐽\n2\nW\n2\n=m\n2\nJ\n2\n for massive particles. </TASK_OUTPUT>\n\nSUMMARY\n\n<TASK_OUTPUT> The Pauli-Lubanski spin vector is a crucial concept in relativistic quantum mechanics and particle physics, providing a relativistic description of spin properties.

Several factors contribute to this noise characterization, and they significantly affect the computation of the false alarm rate (FAR). Here are the key factors:\n\n### 1. **Types of Noise:**\n   - **Shot Noise:** Arises from the quantum nature of light and is significant at high frequencies. It is related to the number of photons detected.\n   - **Seismic Noise:** Caused by ground vibrations, which can affect the sensitivity of the detectors, especially at low frequencies.\n   - **Thermal Noise:** Results from the thermal motion of the test masses and other components, affecting the sensitivity at intermediate frequencies.\n   - **Gravity Gradient Noise:** Fluctuations in the gravitational field can induce noise in the detector.\n   - **Laser Frequency Noise:** Variations in the laser frequency can introduce noise in the measurement.\n\n### 2. **Detector Sensitivity:**\n   - The sensitivity curve of a gravitational wave detector (like LIGO or Virgo) describes how the noise varies with frequency. This curve is essential for understanding how different types of noise affect the detection of signals across the frequency spectrum.\n\n### 3. **Environmental Factors:**\n   - External factors such as weather, human activity, and even cosmic events can introduce noise. These factors can lead to variations in the noise floor and affect the overall sensitivity of the detector.\n\n### 4. **Data Quality:**\n   - The quality of the data collected can be affected by transient noise events (glitches) that can mask or mimic gravitational wave signals. Identifying and mitigating these glitches is crucial for accurate noise characterization.\n\n### 5. **Calibration:**\n   - Accurate calibration of the detector is necessary to ensure that the measured signals correspond correctly to gravitational wave strains. Calibration errors can introduce systematic noise.\n\n### Impact on False Alarm Rate (FAR):\n\nThe false alarm rate is a measure of how often a noise fluctuation could be misidentified as a gravitational wave signal. The characterization of detector noise directly influences the FAR in the following ways:\n\n1. **Threshold Setting:** The FAR is calculated based on the noise characteristics. A well-characterized noise spectrum allows for the setting of appropriate thresholds for signal detection. If the noise is underestimated, the threshold may be set too low, leading to a higher FAR.\n\n2. **Statistical Modeling:** The noise distribution (often modeled as Gaussian or non-Gaussian) is used to compute the probability of observing a signal-like event purely due to noise. Accurate modeling of the noise is essential for reliable FAR calculations.\n\n3. **Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR):** The SNR of a potential signal is compared against the noise floor. A higher noise level can lead to a higher FAR, as more noise events may mimic the characteristics of a gravitational wave signal.\n\n4. **Data Analysis Techniques:** Different data analysis techniques (e.g., matched filtering, machine learning) rely on the noise characterization to optimize detection algorithms. The effectiveness of these techniques in reducing the FAR depends on how well the noise is understood.\n\nIn summary, the characterization of detector noise is a complex interplay of various noise sources, environmental factors, and calibration efforts.

The SNR used in range calculations is determined by finding the SNR where the false alarm rate crosses a certain threshold. This relationship is affected by detector noise, which can lead to incorrectly discounting a detection of a real signal as noise.\n\nTechniques for Reducing Noise\n\nVarious techniques are deployed to reduce noise and detect gravitational waves, including:\n\nVibration isolation systems: such as the Superattenuator in Advanced Virgo.\nSqueezed states of light: implemented in Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo.\nFractal analysis: a new method based on fractal analysis to characterize the output of a physical detector.\nImpact of Non-Gaussian and Non-Stationary Noise\n\nNon-Gaussian and non-stationary noise distributions can significantly impact the characterization of detector noise and the computation of the false alarm rate in gravitational wave observations. The presence of non-Gaussian noise, such as scattered light noise, can disturb stable interferometer operation and limit the sensitivity of GW detectors. Non-stationary noise, which is defined as noise with statistical moments that are not stationary, can also affect the accuracy of gravitational wave signal detection.\n\nMethods for Addressing Non-Gaussian and Non-Stationary Noise\n\nSeveral methods have been proposed to address the impact of non-Gaussian and non-stationarity on gravitational wave observations. These include:\n\nUsing a robust statistical framework based on heavier-tailed likelihoods, such as the symmetric hyperbolic likelihood\nApplying a filter with approximating dominant amplitude behavior of the CBC signal during the inspiral phase\nUtilizing the PSD variation statistic to track local variations in the PSD\nDeveloping a supervised learning framework called iDQ to autonomously detect noise artifacts in gravitational-wave detectors\nRole of Environmental and Instrumental States\n\nEnvironmental and instrumental states, such as ground motions and optics suspensions, play a significant role in characterizing detector noise and affecting the false alarm rate in gravitational wave observations. These states can cause non-stationary and non-Gaussian noise, referred to as \"transient noise\", which can hide or imitate gravitational-wave signals, leading to false detections or increased false alarm rates.\n\nImpact of Environmental and Instrumental States on False Alarm Rate\n\nGlitches, which can be caused by environmental and instrumental states, may mimic a gravitational wave (GW) signal, potentially leading to a false detection or increasing the false alarm rate of a true detection, thereby lowering the significance of the detection. Mitigating these states, such as stabilizing optic suspension components, can reduce the false-positive alert rate. For example, at the LIGO Hanford Observatory (LHO), the rate of high-power glitches was reduced from \n0.82\n0.82 to \n0.18\n0.18 per minute, and the resulting false-positive alert rate dropped from \n55\n%\n55% to \n21\n%\n21%.\n\nImpact of Systematic Errors in Calibration\n\nSystematic errors in calibration can significantly impact the characterization of detector noise and the computation of the false alarm rate in gravitational wave observations. These errors can distort detector data, potentially producing incorrect astrophysical results, and bias signal analyses, which may suggest violations of general relativity.\n\nEffects of Systematic Errors in Calibration\n\nSystematic errors in calibration affect the conversion of optical power fluctuation back into an estimated spacetime strain, as the calibration process accounts for both the interferometer's optomechanical response and the feedback control loop used to control the interferometer test masses. The estimated strain data and estimated strain can be written, showing that errors in the estimate of the response function \n𝑅\nR will cause errors in the estimated free-running strain \n𝑑\nd.\n\nCharacterization of Detector Noise and False Alarm Rate\n\nThe characterization of detector noise and computation of the false alarm rate in gravitational wave observations can be impacted by systematic errors in calibration, which are often modeled using a Gaussian Process (GP) prior to capture possible systematic errors between the modeled and measured detector responses. The calibration uncertainty acts to produce extra noise in the detector at each frequency, and that extra noise scales with the size of the signal at that frequency, with no limit to how much the calibration uncertainty can hurt the inference.\n\nImpact on Black Hole Spectroscopy and Tests of General Relativity\n\nSystematic errors in detector calibration can bias signal analyses and potentially lead to incorrect interpretations suggesting violations of general relativity. Specifically, calibration errors must remain \n≲\n6\n%\n≲6% in magnitude and \n≲\n4\n∘\n≲4\n∘\n in phase to avoid introducing biases in black hole ringdown analyses. Calibration errors could have a minor effect in parameterized tests of GR that modify the phase of waveform, but \n<\n20\n%\n<20% of amplitude calibration error or \n<\n10\n−\n20\n∘\n<10−20\n∘\n of phase calibration error should not lead to significant biases for all but the strongest signals in the advanced LIGO era.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe characterization of detector noise in gravitational wave observations is a complex task that involves understanding various factors that contribute to noise. Systematic errors in calibration can significantly impact the characterization of detector noise and the computation of the false alarm rate. It is essential to carefully estimate and mitigate these errors to ensure the accuracy of astrophysical conclusions drawn from gravitational wave data.\n\nReferences\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-13329-4\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.109.082002\nhttps://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/523/2/2928/7177539\nhttps://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation?paperid=71246\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/6hs618/casting_doubt_on_all_three_ligo_detections/.json\nhttps://nanograv.org/15yr/Summary/Detector\nhttps://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022Galax..10...12D/abstract\nhttps://www.sciencepub.net/nature/nsj190621/03_37311nsj190621_22_25.pdf\nhttp://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Gravitational_Waves:_Ground-Based_Interferometric_Detectors\nhttps://orbi.uliege.be/bitstream/2268/294992/1/Thesis_Gregory_Baltus.pdf\nhttps://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1740-9713.01488\nhttps://inspirehep.net/literature/2015054\nhttps://pubs.aip.org/aip/rsi/article/94/5/054501/2890777/Reducing-control-noise-in-gravitational-wave\nhttps://par.nsf.gov/biblio/10327954-characterization-gravitational-wave-detector-noise-fractals\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.2.033066\nhttps://dcc.ligo.org/LIGO-P2200268/public\nhttps://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ado8069\nhttps://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6382/acf01f\nhttps://inspirehep.net/literature/2037538\nhttps://arxiv.org/html/2412.09832v1\nhttps://surface.syr.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1242&context=phy\nhttps://scholarsbank.uoregon.edu/items/e9d16445-9ae8-479e-8355-d2e42b12376a\nhttps://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9918497/\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.110.122002\nhttps://arxiv.org/html/2311.09159v2\nhttps://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41114-017-0004-1\nhttps://repositorio.uam.es/bitstream/handle/10486/707017/9230633.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y\nhttps://dcc.ligo.org/LIGO-G2201148/public\nhttps://inspirehep.net/literature/2150574\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05475.pdf\nhttps://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/1740-9713.01488\nhttps://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation?paperid=71246\nhttps://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/523/2/2928/7177539\nhttps://authors.library.caltech.edu/records/war4e-gr620/preview/PhysRevD.111.084019.pdf\nhttps://arxiv.org/html/2411.13058v1\nhttps://www.raa-journal.org/issues/all/2022/v22n11/202211/P020221110637813974286.pdf\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.107.023027\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12117.pdf\nhttps://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6382/ac8862/pdf\nhttps://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6382/ad4509/pdf </FINAL_DETAILED_REPORT>", "marvel_deepsearch_score": 8, "evaluation_model_type": "openai", "evaluation_model_name": "gpt-4o-mini", "qa_model_type": "openai", "qa_model_name": "gpt-4o-mini", "gpt4o_mini_answer_relevancy": 0.98, "gpt4o_mini_answer_correctness": 0.87, "gpt4o_mini_faithfulness": 0.05, "marvel_standard_answer_relevancy": 0.98, "marvel_standard_answer_correctness": 0.87, "marvel_standard_faithfulness": 0.92, "marvel_deepsearch_answer_relevancy": 0.95, "marvel_deepsearch_answer_correctness": 0.87, "marvel_deepsearch_faithfulness": 0.87}

These events have been observed with varying signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), with GW170729 detected by three detectors with a poorly measured $v_g$ due to its lower SNR, while GW150914 and GW170608 were observed by two detectors.\n\nThe constituent masses, spins, luminosity distances, and signal-to-noise ratios for these events are as follows:\n\nGW170817: \n𝑀\n1\n=\n1.3\n6\n−\n0.10\n+\n0.18\n𝑀\n⊙\nM\n1\n\t​\n\n=1.36\n−0.10\n+0.18\n\t​\n\nM\n⊙\n\t​\n\n and \n𝑀\n2\n=\n1.2\n6\n−\n0.09\n+\n0.17\n𝑀\n⊙\nM\n2\n\t​\n\n=1.26\n−0.09\n+0.17\n\t​\n\nM\n⊙\n\t​\n\n, \n𝐷\n𝐿\n=\n0.0\n5\n−\n0.01\n+\n0.01\nD\nL\n\t​\n\n=0.05\n−0.01\n+0.01\n\t​\n\n Gpc, SNR: \n32.4\n32.4\nGW170608: \n𝑀\n1\n=\n15.\n4\n−\n3.8\n+\n5.1\n𝑀\n⊙\nM\n1\n\t​\n\n=15.4\n−3.8\n+5.1\n\t​\n\nM\n⊙\n\t​\n\n and \n𝑀\n2\n=\n7.\n7\n−\n1.7\n+\n2.9\n𝑀\n⊙\nM\n2\n\t​\n\n=7.7\n−1.7\n+2.9\n\t​\n\nM\n⊙\n\t​\n\n, \n𝐷\n𝐿\n=\n0.3\n4\n−\n0.09\n+\n0.17\nD\nL\n\t​\n\n=0.34\n−0.09\n+0.17\n\t​\n\n Gpc\nGW151226: \n𝑀\n1\n=\n13.\n7\n−\n2.9\n+\n4.2\n𝑀\n⊙\nM\n1\n\t​\n\n=13.7\n−2.9\n+4.2\n\t​\n\nM\n⊙\n\t​\n\n and \n𝑀\n2\n=\n7.\n5\n−\n1.5\n+\n2.5\n𝑀\n⊙\nM\n2\n\t​\n\n=7.5\n−1.5\n+2.5\n\t​\n\nM\n⊙\n\t​\n\n, SNR: \n13.1\n13.1, \n𝐷\n𝐿\n=\n0.4\n4\n−\n0.13\n+\n0.22\nD\nL\n\t​\n\n=0.44\n−0.13\n+0.22\n\t​\n\n Gpc\nGW150914: \n𝑀\n1\n=\n38.\n0\n−\n3.8\n+\n5.3\n𝑀\n⊙\nM\n1\n\t​\n\n=38.0\n−3.8\n+5.3\n\t​\n\nM\n⊙\n\t​\n\n and \n𝑀\n2\n=\n29.\n9\n−\n3.1\n+\n3.7\n𝑀\n⊙\nM\n2\n\t​\n\n=29.9\n−3.1\n+3.7\n\t​\n\nM\n⊙\n\t​\n\n, SNR: \n24\n24, \n𝐷\n𝐿\n=\n0.4\n1\n−\n0.12\n+\n0.18\nD\nL\n\t​\n\n=0.41\n−0.12\n+0.18\n\t​\n\n Gpc\nGW170729: \n𝑀\n1\n=\n34.\n9\n−\n9.1\n+\n13.8\n𝑀\n⊙\nM\n1\n\t​\n\n=34.9\n−9.1\n+13.8\n\t​\n\nM\n⊙\n\t​\n\n and \n𝑀\n2\n=\n24.\n5\n−\n6.6\n+\n11.2\n𝑀\n⊙\nM\n2\n\t​\n\n=24.5\n−6.6\n+11.2\n\t​\n\nM\n⊙\n\t​\n\n, \n𝐷\n𝐿\n=\n2.\n4\n−\n0.8\n+\n1.3\nD\nL\n\t​\n\n=2.4\n−0.8\n+1.3\n\t​\n\n Gpc\n\nThe effective spin parameters for these events are:\n\nGW170729: \n𝜒\n𝑒\n𝑓\n𝑓\n=\n0.3\n5\n−\n0.17\n+\n0.19\nχ\neff\n\t​\n\n=0.35\n−0.17\n+0.19\n\t​\n\nGW170608: \n𝜒\n𝑒\n𝑓\n𝑓\n=\n0.0\n7\n−\n0.20\n+\n0.23\nχ\neff\n\t​\n\n=0.07\n−0.20\n+0.23\n\t​\n\nGW151226: \n𝜒\n𝑒\n𝑓\n𝑓\n=\n0.2\n1\n−\n0.15\n+\n0.20\nχ\neff\n\t​\n\n=0.21\n−0.15\n+0.20\n\t​\n\nGW150914: \n𝜒\n𝑒\n𝑓\n𝑓\n=\n0.0\n2\n−\n0.14\n+\n0.15\nχ\neff\n\t​\n\n=0.02\n−0.14\n+0.15\n\t​\n\n\nThese gravitational wave events offer various useful properties for testing different aspects of general relativity.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n<TASK_OUTPUT>\n\nReferences\nGWTC-1: A gravitational-wave transient catalog of compact binary mergers observed by LIGO and Virgo during the first and second observing runs\nFirst observation of gravitational waves\nGW170817\nGW170608\nGW151226\nGW150914\nGW170729\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_observation_of_gravitational_waves\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.102.024028.pdf\nhttps://cplberry.com/tag/gw170817\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.119.161101.pdf\nhttps://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/1468/1/012218/pdf\nhttps://www.ligo.org/science/Publication-GW170608/index.php.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GW170817\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GW170608\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GW151226\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GW150914\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GW170729\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.120.091101.pdf\nhttps://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20210013876/downloads/Properties%20of%20the%20Binary%20Neutron%20Star%20Merger%20GW170817.pdf%20sti.pdf </TASK_OUTPUT>", "marvel_deepsearch_score": 8, "evaluation_model_type": "openai", "evaluation_model_name": "gpt-4o-mini", "qa_model_type": "openai", "qa_model_name": "gpt-4o-mini", "gpt4o_mini_answer_relevancy": 0.98, "gpt4o_mini_answer_correctness": 0.87, "gpt4o_mini_faithfulness": 0.85, "marvel_standard_answer_relevancy": 0.0, "marvel_standard_answer_correctness": 0.0, "marvel_standard_faithfulness": 0.0, "marvel_deepsearch_answer_relevancy": 0.95, "marvel_deepsearch_answer_correctness": 0.98, "marvel_deepsearch_faithfulness": 0.98}

This process is particularly relevant in the context of the formation of supermassive black holes in the centers of galaxies and the population of stellar-mass black holes observed in gravitational wave events.\n\n### Effects on Average Mass and Spin\n\n1. **Mass Growth**: Each merger event typically results in a black hole that is more massive than the individual black holes that merged. This leads to a population of black holes with a broader mass distribution, particularly in the case of supermassive black holes. The mass of the resulting black hole is generally less than the sum of the masses of the merging black holes due to the release of energy in the form of gravitational waves.\n\n2. **Spin Dynamics**: The spins of merging black holes can also be affected by hierarchical mergers. The final spin of the merged black hole is influenced by the spins of the progenitor black holes and their orbital angular momentum. If the spins are aligned, the final spin can be significantly higher, while misaligned spins can lead to lower final spins due to the complex dynamics of the merger process.\n\n3. **Spin Distribution**: Hierarchical mergers can lead to a diverse spin distribution among black holes. For instance, if black holes formed from different stellar populations or in different environments (like dense stellar clusters) merge, the resulting black holes may exhibit a range of spins, reflecting the varied formation histories.\n\n### Implications for Gravitational Wave Studies\n\n1. **Gravitational Wave Signatures**: The mass and spin of black holes directly influence the gravitational wave signals produced during mergers. The frequency, amplitude, and waveform of gravitational waves depend on these parameters. Understanding the average mass and spin distributions helps in modeling the expected gravitational wave signals and interpreting the data from detectors like LIGO and Virgo.\n\n2. **Population Studies**: Observations of gravitational waves from black hole mergers allow astronomers to infer the population characteristics of black holes, including their mass and spin distributions. This can provide insights into the formation mechanisms of black holes, including the role of hierarchical mergers.\n\n3. **Cosmological Implications**: The study of black hole mergers and their spins can also shed light on the evolution of galaxies and the growth of supermassive black holes over cosmic time. By understanding how hierarchical mergers contribute to black hole populations, researchers can better model the history of structure formation in the universe.\n\n4. **Testing General Relativity**: The spins of black holes can also be used to test predictions of general relativity. The dynamics of merging black holes, particularly in extreme spin configurations, can lead to unique gravitational wave signatures that may provide evidence for or against alternative theories of gravity.\n\nIn summary, hierarchical mergers of black holes play a crucial role in shaping their mass and spin distributions, which in turn have significant implications for the study of gravitational waves and our understanding of the universe's evolution. As gravitational wave astronomy continues to advance, these relationships will become increasingly important for interpreting observations and refining our models of black hole formation and growth.", "gpt4o_mini_score": 9, "marvel_standard_answer": "Hierarchical mergers of black holes affect their average mass and spins by potentially increasing mass and altering spin magnitudes and orientations.

These mergers can significantly impact the average mass spins of black holes, affecting their properties and the study of gravitational waves.\n\nIntroduction to Hierarchical Mergers\n\nHierarchical mergers involve the repeated merging of smaller black holes to form larger ones. This process can occur in dense star clusters, where black holes are dynamically assembled into binaries, leading to isotropic spin orientations [1]. The study of hierarchical mergers provides insights into the contribution to the observed spin distribution and its implications for gravitational wave studies.\n\nImpact on Average Mass Spins\n\nBlack holes formed through hierarchical mergers are expected to have a unique spin distribution, peaking around \n𝑎\n𝑓\n∼\n0.7\na\nf\n\t​\n\n∼0.7 [2]. However, gravitational-wave kicks can eject remnants from their host environments, allowing only retained black holes to participate in subsequent mergers. The spin distribution of retained black holes in typical globular clusters has been calculated, and it has been found that higher-generation black holes have a spin distribution that does not converge to a unique form, instead spanning a broad range of spins, \n𝑎\n𝑓\n∈\n(\n0.4\n,\n1\n)\na\nf\n\t​\n\n∈(0.4,1), depending on their merger history, birth spins, and the escape velocity [3].\n\nImplications for Gravitational Wave Studies\n\nThe study of hierarchical mergers has significant implications for the study of gravitational waves. Hierarchical mergers can produce black holes with masses within the pair-instability mass gap, which is a range of masses where black holes are not expected to form through isolated stellar evolution [4]. The detection of gravitational waves from these mergers can reveal the properties of black holes and their role in the universe.\n\nCharacteristics of Hierarchical Mergers\n\nHierarchical mergers are characterized by higher masses, possibly within the pair-instability mass gap, and dimensionless spins clustered at the characteristic value of \n∼\n0.7\n∼0.7 [5]. The environments that are likely to produce hierarchical mergers include nuclear star clusters and accretion disks surrounding active galactic nuclei, which can overcome the relativistic recoils imparted to black-hole merger remnants.\n\nSpecific Astrophysical Conditions Required\n\nThe specific astrophysical conditions required for hierarchical mergers of black holes to occur and produce distinctive gravitational-wave signatures include environments with escape speeds of \n≳\n100\n≳100 km/s, such as nuclear star clusters and accretion disks surrounding active galactic nuclei. These conditions allow for the overcoming of relativistic recoils imparted to black-hole merger remnants. The distinctive gravitational-wave signatures of hierarchical mergers include higher masses, possibly within the pair-instability mass gap, and dimensionless spins clustered at the characteristic value of \n∼\n0.7\n∼0.7.\n\nRetention of Merger Remnants\n\nThe most important condition for hierarchical mergers to occur is that remnants formed by mergers are retained by the host star cluster [6]. Studies have shown that \n∼\n17\n∼17 (2) remnants of GWTC-2 may be retained by the host star cluster if all GWTC-2 events occurred in nuclear (globular) clusters.\n\nDifferences in Gravitational Wave Signatures\n\nThe differences in gravitational wave signatures between hierarchical mergers of black holes and mergers of black holes formed through isolated stellar evolution include:\n\nMass: Hierarchical mergers result in higher-mass black holes, potentially within the pair-instability mass gap.\nSpin: Black holes from hierarchical mergers have larger spins, typically around \n𝜒\n∼\n0.7\nχ∼0.7, while those from isolated stellar evolution have lower spins (\n𝜒\n≲\n0.1\nχ≲0.1).\nFormation Environment: Hierarchical mergers require dense environments like nuclear star clusters or active galactic nuclei disks to facilitate multiple mergers, overcoming the recoil kicks from gravitational wave emission.\nDifferences in Spin Distributions\n\nThe spin distribution of black holes formed through hierarchical mergers is distinct from those formed through other astrophysical processes. Black holes formed through hierarchical mergers have a broader range of spin values, peaking at \n𝑎\n∼\n0.7\na∼0.7, and are more likely to have higher spins, particularly for higher-mass black holes. In contrast, black holes formed through isolated stellar binaries have lower spin magnitudes, peaking around \n𝜒\n∼\n0.2\nχ∼0.2. The spin distribution of hierarchical mergers can span a broad range of spins, \n𝑎\n∈\n(\n0.4\n,\n1\n)\na∈(0.4,1), depending on their merger history, birth spins, and the escape velocity.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, hierarchical mergers of black holes significantly impact their average mass spins, affecting their properties and the study of gravitational waves. The study of hierarchical mergers provides insights into the formation and evolution of compact binaries, and the detection of gravitational waves from these mergers can reveal the properties of black holes and their role in the universe.\n\nReferences\n\n[1] https://astrobites.org/2025/04/07/gw_kicks_impact_bh_spins_in_hierarchical_mergers/\n\n[2] https://arxiv.org/html/2503.21278v1\n\n[3] https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21278\n\n[4] https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/black-holes-differ-in-mass-and-spin-may-have-formed-in-different-ways/\n\n[5] https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-021-01398-w\n\n[6] https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07179\n\n[7] https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.03439.pdf\n\n[8] http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021NatAs...5..749G/abstract\n\n[9] https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024asi..confO..42M\n\n[10] https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2022/10/aa44257-22/aa44257-22.html\n\n[11] https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ab7fac\n\n[12] https://aasnova.org/2025/07/29/the-black-hole-tango-kicks-and-spins-in-hierarchical-mergers\n\n[13] https://www.mdpi.com/2073-8994/13/9/1678\n\n[14] https://www.hilarispublisher.com/open-access/gravitational-wave-signatures-from-binary-black-hole-merger-events.pdf\n\n[15] https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/502/2/2049/6108278\n\n[16] https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ac20db\n\n[17] https://www.aei.mpg.de/1244528/towards-a-deeper-understanding-of-black-hole-origins\n\n[18] https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/addec6\n\n[19] https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025ApJ...987..146B/abstract\n\n[20] https://arxiv.org/html/2508.14316v3\n\n[21] https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2024/12/aa52545-24/aa52545-24.html\n\nThe implications of hierarchical mergers for gravitational wave studies include:\n\nDistinctive gravitational-wave signatures, such as higher masses and dimensionless spins clustered at \n∼\n0.7\n∼0.7.\nInsights into the formation and evolution of compact binaries.\nThe detection of gravitational waves from these mergers can reveal the properties of black holes and their role in the universe.\n\n</FINAL_DETAILED_REPORT> </end_header_id", "marvel_deepsearch_score": 8, "evaluation_model_type": "openai", "evaluation_model_name": "gpt-4o-mini", "qa_model_type": "openai", "qa_model_name": "gpt-4o-mini", "gpt4o_mini_answer_relevancy": 0.98, "gpt4o_mini_answer_correctness": 0.87, "gpt4o_mini_faithfulness": 0.82, "marvel_standard_answer_relevancy": 0.87, "marvel_standard_answer_correctness": 0.85, "marvel_standard_faithfulness": 0.87, "marvel_deepsearch_answer_relevancy": 0.95, "marvel_deepsearch_answer_correctness": 0.87, "marvel_deepsearch_faithfulness": 0.85}

However, glitch-induced transient continuous wave signals from PSR J0537-6910 appear to be detectable by current generation detectors, posing a challenge for the modeling of next generation detectors.", "gpt4o_mini_answer": "The top priority pulsars for detectability estimates, particularly in the context of gravitational wave astronomy, often include well-known millisecond pulsars (MSPs) such as PSR J1939+2134, PSR J1744-1134, and PSR J0613-0200. These pulsars are prioritized due to their stable rotation, high spin frequencies, and relatively close proximity to Earth, which enhance their potential for gravitational wave detection.\n\n### Challenges Presented by Glitch-Induced Transients\n\n1. **Signal Interference**: Glitches are sudden changes in the rotation rate of a pulsar, which can introduce noise and variability in the timing of the pulsar's signals. This can complicate the detection of gravitational waves, as the timing residuals may be affected by these glitches, masking the signals we are trying to detect.\n\n2. **Modeling Difficulties**: The occurrence of glitches can be unpredictable and vary significantly between different pulsars. This variability makes it challenging to create accurate models for the expected gravitational wave signals, as the timing models must account for these transient events.\n\n3. **Data Analysis Complexity**: The presence of glitches requires sophisticated data analysis techniques to separate the gravitational wave signals from the noise introduced by these transients. Current generation detectors may struggle with this complexity, as they need to filter out glitch-related noise while still being sensitive to potential gravitational wave signals.\n\n4. **Timing Residuals**: Glitches can lead to large timing residuals that can obscure the long-term trends needed to identify gravitational wave signals. This can reduce the effective sensitivity of pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) to gravitational waves.\n\n5. **Increased Computational Load**: The need to account for glitches in data analysis increases the computational load on the algorithms used to search for gravitational waves, potentially limiting the speed and efficiency of detection efforts.\n\nOverall, while pulsars remain a promising avenue for gravitational wave detection, the challenges posed by glitch-induced transients necessitate ongoing research and development in both observational techniques and data analysis methodologies.", "gpt4o_mini_score": 3, "marvel_standard_answer": "<QUERY> What are the top priority pulsars identified for detectability estimates based on the energy model assumptions, and what challenges do glitch-induced transients present for current generation detectors?.

These rotating neutron stars emit periodic electromagnetic radiation and generally slow down as they lose energy, but some also experience glitches. The detection of transient quasi-monochromatic gravitational waves from glitching pulsars presents both opportunities and challenges, particularly with current and future detectors.\n\n## The Importance of Glitching Pulsars\n\nGlitching pulsars are significant because they can provide insights into the internal structure and composition of neutron stars. The study of these pulsars involves exploring different models that estimate their detectability based on energy model assumptions. Specifically, six different models have been proposed to assess the detectability of glitching pulsars, focusing on top priority pulsars [1](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/532/4/3893/7712489).\n\n## Challenges Posed by Glitch-Induced Transients\n\nHowever, the detection of gravitational waves from glitching pulsars is complicated by glitch-induced transients. These transients present challenges for current generation detectors, which are afflicted by transient noise artefacts known as 'glitches' that contaminate the signals and bias inferences [2](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/520/2/2983/7028786). The top priority pulsars identified for detectability estimates based on energy model assumptions face these challenges, which can affect the accuracy of gravitational wave detection.\n\n## Current Research and Findings\n\nSeveral studies have investigated the prospects for detecting transient quasi-monochromatic gravitational waves from glitching pulsars. Research available on [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/366361654_Prospects_for_detecting_transient_quasi-monochromatic_gravitational_waves_from_glitching_pulsars_with_current_and_future_detectors) discusses the top priority pulsars for detectability estimates and the challenges posed by glitch-induced transients. Additionally, updates to glitch mitigation methods are discussed in Section 4 of a related article on [IOP Science](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6382/aca238/ampdf).\n\n## Priority Pulsars and Detection Prospects\n\nWhile the specific top priority pulsars are not explicitly mentioned in the available literature, studies such as [McCulloch et al.](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ab9178) provide valuable insights into the detectability of glitching pulsars. Further details on the models and detectability estimates can be found in the full text of the articles [here](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-pdf/532/4/3893/58691262/stae1659.pdf).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe detection of gravitational waves from glitching pulsars holds promise for understanding neutron stars, but it is fraught with challenges, particularly those posed by glitch-induced transients.

The presence of PBHs accelerates the internal dynamics of halos due to dynamical friction with dark matter particles, leading to significant binary perturbed structures, which in turn weakens the gravitational wave constraints on the mass of PBHs.", "gpt4o_mini_answer": "Primordial black holes (PBHs) are hypothetical black holes that could have formed in the early universe due to density fluctuations shortly after the Big Bang. Their formation is thought to be linked to the conditions of the early universe, such as inflation and the subsequent evolution of density perturbations. PBHs can contribute to the formation of dark matter structures in several ways:\n\n1. **Seed Structures**: PBHs can act as seeds for the formation of larger structures in the universe. If PBHs form with sufficient mass, they can gravitationally attract surrounding matter, leading to the growth of halos that can eventually evolve into galaxies and clusters of galaxies. This process can enhance the formation of structures in the universe, especially in the early stages of cosmic evolution.\n\n2. **Dark Matter Candidates**: If PBHs constitute a significant fraction of dark matter, they can influence the dynamics of structure formation. The gravitational effects of PBHs would contribute to the overall gravitational potential in which baryonic matter and other forms of dark matter evolve. This can affect the rate of structure formation and the distribution of matter in the universe.\n\n3. **Mass Distribution**: The mass distribution of PBHs is crucial. If PBHs have a wide range of masses, they can contribute to the formation of structures at different scales. For example, lighter PBHs might cluster and form smaller structures, while heavier PBHs could influence larger scales.\n\n### Gravitational Wave Constraints\n\nThe significance of the fraction of PBH mass in relation to gravitational wave constraints arises from the potential for PBHs to merge and produce gravitational waves. When PBHs form in the early universe, they can have a range of masses, and if they are sufficiently massive, they can eventually collide and merge, emitting gravitational waves in the process.\n\n1. **Gravitational Wave Signals**: The mergers of PBHs can produce detectable gravitational wave signals. Observations from gravitational wave observatories like LIGO and Virgo can place constraints on the abundance and mass distribution of PBHs. If a significant fraction of dark matter is composed of PBHs, the expected merger rates and the characteristics of the resulting gravitational waves can be compared to actual observations.\n\n2. **Mass Fraction Limits**: The fraction of the total mass of dark matter that can be attributed to PBHs is constrained by the observed rates of gravitational wave events. If too many PBHs exist, the merger rates would be higher than what is observed, leading to upper limits on the fraction of dark matter that can be in the form of PBHs. This is particularly relevant for PBHs in certain mass ranges, such as those that could form from inflationary fluctuations.\n\n3. **Cosmological Implications**: The constraints on PBH mass fractions have implications for cosmology and our understanding of dark matter. If PBHs are a significant component of dark matter, their properties and formation mechanisms must be consistent with both gravitational wave observations and the large-scale structure of the universe.\n\nIn summary, PBHs can play a crucial role in the formation of dark matter structures in the early universe, and their contribution is tightly linked to gravitational wave observations, which help constrain their abundance and mass distribution. Understanding these relationships is essential for piecing together the nature of dark matter and the evolution of the universe.", "gpt4o_mini_score": 9, "marvel_standard_answer": "<QUERY>\nHow do primordial black holes (PBHs) contribute to the formation of dark matter structures in the early universe, and what is the significance of the fraction of PBH mass in relation to gravitational wave constraints?\n</QUERY>\n\n<ANSWER>\nPrimordial black holes (PBHs) are considered a potential contributor to dark matter structures in the early universe. They are thought to have formed through the gravitational collapse of pre-existing density fluctuations in the early universe, typically before the first stars. PBHs could account for all or part of dark matter and have different proposed production mechanisms. They can emit gravitational waves, and their formation is linked to density fluctuations in the early universe.\n\nThe contribution of PBHs to dark matter structures is significant, as they could explain the gravitational effects seen in galaxies and galactic clusters. However, their contribution is constrained by various observations, including gravitational lensing, dynamical effects, influence on large-scale structure, accretion, and gravitational waves.\n\nThe fraction of PBH mass in relation to gravitational wave constraints is crucial. The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is expected to detect gravitational waves generated by the violent density fluctuations required to produce PBHs in the early universe.

They are thought to have formed from overdense regions of the universe through gravitational collapse during radiation domination. This article provides an overview of the role of PBHs in dark matter formation and their relation to gravitational wave constraints.\n\n## Formation of Primordial Black Holes\nPBHs are formed from overdensities in the early universe, which collapse under their own gravity to form black holes. The essential ingredient for PBH formation is a fluctuation in the density of the universe, inducing its gravitational collapse, typically requiring density contrasts $\\delta \\rho /\\rho \\sim 0.1$. PBHs could have formed in the very early universe (less than one second after the Big Bang) during the inflationary era or in the very early radiation-dominated era.\n\n## Contribution to Dark Matter\nPBHs can contribute to the formation of dark matter structures in the early universe, potentially explaining the gravitational effects seen in galaxies and galactic clusters if they account for all or a significant amount of the dark matter. The dark matter problem, proposed in 1933 by Swiss-American astronomer Fritz Zwicky, refers to the fact that scientists still do not know what form dark matter takes. PBHs have different proposed production mechanisms and can emit gravitational waves.\n\n## Constraints on Primordial Black Holes\nThe formation of dark matter structures in the early universe through PBHs is constrained by various observations, which impose limits on the dark matter fraction as a function of PBH mass function parameters. A PBH mass function is described by three parameters: a characteristic mass, width, and dark matter fraction. Considering an extended mass function, constraints become more stringent compared to a monochromatic mass function. There are three mass windows where PBHs can constitute all the dark matter: around $5 \\times 10^{-16} M_{\\odot}$, $2 \\times 10^{-14} M_{\\odot}$, and $25-100 M_{\\odot}$. However, including all bounds, PBHs can only constitute of order $10\\%$ of the dark matter.\n\n## Gravitational Wave Constraints\nThe fraction of PBH mass in relation to gravitational wave constraints is significant. PBHs could provide the dark matter in various mass windows below $10^2 M_{\\odot}$ and those of $30 M_{\\odot}$ might explain the LIGO events. The observation of gravitational waves from LIGO, Virgo, KAGRA collaboration, and stochastic detectors constrains possible masses of PBHs. With these constraints, there remains a parameter space to explain dark matter with a certain recipe of PBHs.\n\n## Recent Studies and Findings\nRecent studies have constrained the interpretation of PBHs as dark matter. The increased two-body interaction rate has a significant impact on the dynamics of stellar systems, and gravitational lensing gets modified. The accumulated experimental data collectively constrain the fraction of PBH DM, $f_{PBH}$, to be below unity. A robust Monte Carlo approach was used in conjunction with a radiatively inefficient PBH accretion model with commonly accepted model parameters to investigate constraints on the PBH DM using NuSTAR Galactic center (GC) X-ray data.\n\n## Conclusion\nIn conclusion, primordial black holes (PBHs) are a potential contributor to dark matter structures in the early universe. While they can form dark matter, their existence is constrained by various observations, including gravitational wave constraints. Further research is needed to understand the role of PBHs in dark matter formation and their relation to gravitational wave constraints.\n\n## References\n- [Primordial Black Holes and Dark Matter](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2212686422000887)\n- [Constraints on Primordial Black Holes](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34874316/)\n- [PBH Bounds and Gravitational Waves](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0550321324000609)\n- [Primordial Black Holes and Exotic Compact Objects](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.133.111401)\n- [The Hunt for Primordial Black Holes](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/12/201228095432.htm)", "marvel_standard_score": 8, "marvel_deepsearch_answer": "KEY_FACTS\n\n<TASK_OUTPUT>\n\nPrimordial black holes (PBHs) are considered a potential contributor to dark matter structures in the early universe, potentially explaining the gravitational effects seen in galaxies and galactic clusters if they account for all or a significant amount of the dark matter [@\"url:https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2212686422000887\"].\nThe fraction of PBH mass in relation to gravitational wave constraints is significant, as it constrains possible masses of PBHs and their contribution to dark matter.\nRecent studies have constrained the fraction of PBH DM, \n𝑓\n𝑃\n𝐵\n𝐻\nf\nPBH\n\t​\n\n, to be below unity.\nThe relationship between the merger rate of PBHs and the stochastic gravitational wave background provides valuable insights into the properties of PBHs, particularly their mass function.\nThe fraction of PBH mass in dark matter is constrained to be \n𝑓\n𝑃\n𝐵\n𝐻\n≲\n𝑂\n(\n10\n−\n3\n)\nf\nPBH\n\t​\n\n≲O(10\n−3\n) in the mass range of interest for current GW detectors.\nThere are three mass windows where PBHs can constitute all the dark matter: around \n5\n×\n10\n−\n16\n𝑀\n⊙\n5×10\n−16\nM\n⊙\n\t​\n\n, \n2\n×\n10\n−\n14\n𝑀\n⊙\n2×10\n−14\nM\n⊙\n\t​\n\n, and \n25\n−\n100\n𝑀\n⊙\n25−100M\n⊙\n\t​\n\n.\nPBHs could provide the dark matter in various mass windows below \n10\n2\n𝑀\n⊙\n10\n2\nM\n⊙\n\t​\n\n and those of \n30\n𝑀\n⊙\n30M\n⊙\n\t​\n\n might explain the LIGO events.\nThe observation of gravitational waves from LIGO, Virgo, KAGRA collaboration, and stochastic detectors constrains possible masses of PBHs.\nA mixed population of astrophysical black holes and primordial black holes could explain the observed merger events, with approximately \n1\n/\n4\n1/4 of the detectable events in the third gravitational wave transient catalog attributed to primordial black hole binaries.\nThe local merger rate of PBH binaries is in the range \n23.5\n−\n30.3\n \nG\np\nc\n−\n3\n \ny\nr\n−\n1\n23.5−30.3 Gpc\n−3\nyr\n−1\n, with a redshift evolution index of the PBH merger rate \n𝛼\n=\n2.1\n9\n−\n0.16\n+\n0.16\nα=2.19\n−0.16\n+0.16\n\t​\n\n at 68% confidence level [@\"url:https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21332\"].\nThe stochastic background of gravitational waves is generated by the mergers of PBH binaries, and its energy density can be related to the merger rate of PBHs, constraining the PBH mass function.\nThe wider the PBH mass function, the wider the peak and the lower the peak amplitude of the GW background.\nIncluding all bounds, PBHs can only constitute of order \n10\n%\n10% of the dark matter. </TASK_OUTPUT>\nFINER_DETAILS\n\n<TASK_OUTPUT> The formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) is a complex process that involves the collapse of overdense regions in the early universe, typically requiring density contrasts \n𝛿\n𝜌\n/\n𝜌\n∼\n0.1\nδρ/ρ∼0.1 [@\"url:https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0550321324000609\"].

They are thought to have formed from overdense regions of the universe through gravitational collapse during radiation domination. The existence of PBHs is constrained by various observations, including gravitational wave constraints. The relationship between the mass of PBHs and the observed stochastic gravitational wave background constrains the fraction of PBH mass in dark matter to be $f_{PBH} \\lesssim \\mathcal{O}(10^{-3})$ in the mass range of interest for current GW detectors. Recent studies have constrained the interpretation of PBHs as dark matter, and the accumulated experimental data collectively constrain the fraction of PBH DM, $f_{PBH}$, to be below unity. A robust Monte Carlo approach was used in conjunction with a radiatively inefficient PBH accretion model with commonly accepted model parameters to investigate constraints on the PBH DM using NuSTAR Galactic center (GC) X-ray data.\n\nThe observed LIGO and Virgo gravitational wave signals have significant implications for the possible mass distribution of primordial black holes (PBHs) as dark matter candidates. The number of merger events observed by LIGO-Virgo constrains the mass distribution of PBHs. If all dark matter were in the form of multi-Solar mass PBHs, there would be several orders of magnitude more merger events than observed, thus constraining \n𝑓\n𝑃\n𝐵\n𝐻\nf\nPBH\n\t​\n\n, the fraction of dark matter that could be composed of PBHs.\n\nThe implications of the relationship between PBH mass and SGWB for dark matter are significant. According to https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2018/10/aa33483-18/aa33483-18.html, LIGO and Virgo gravitational wave measurements have led to speculations that observed mergers might be due to \n𝑂\n(\n10\n)\n𝑀\n⊙\nO(10)M\n⊙\n\t​\n\n primordial black holes (PBHs), and that the whole amount of dark matter (DM) might be in that exotic form. However, several recent works have shown that this interpretation is strongly constrained.\n\nIn conclusion, primordial black holes (PBHs) are a potential contributor to dark matter structures in the early universe. While they can form dark matter, their existence is constrained by various observations, including gravitational wave constraints. Further research is needed to understand the role of PBHs in dark matter formation and their relation to gravitational wave constraints.\n\nThe relationship between the merger rate of primordial black holes (PBHs) and the stochastic gravitational wave background has been a subject of interest in recent studies. This relationship is crucial in understanding the properties of PBHs, particularly their mass function. Recent studies have investigated the relationship between the merger rate of PBHs and the stochastic gravitational wave background.

Affiliations are essential for research articles, as they help determine the credibility of the research and facilitate the validation of funding information.\n\n## What are Author Affiliations?\n\nAuthor affiliations typically include departments, institutions, and locations where the research was conducted. According to Cambridge's author affiliation policy, affiliations should represent the institution(s) at which the research presented was conducted and/or supported and/or approved. For non-research content, affiliations should represent the institution(s) with which each author is currently affiliated.\n\n## How to List Author Affiliations\n\nWhen listing author affiliations, it is essential to follow specific guidelines. Each author usually has at least one or multiple affiliations, which can be edited in the Metadata Form. If authors have multiple affiliations, all affiliations must be entered as separate entries. The corresponding author's information should include their name, degree(s), group/school/department, institution, mailing address (excluding postal code for non-corresponding authors), phone number, fax number, and email address.\n\n## Examples of Author Affiliations\n\n* The affiliations of authors in a research article are typically listed with a university or research institution.

The linear ramp approach implies a direct relationship between frequency and time, while the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process accounts for stochastic variations, leading to more accurate phase tracking.", "gpt4o_mini_answer": "The Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process is a significant stochastic process in various fields, including physics, finance, and biology, particularly in the context of modeling phase evolution. Its importance arises from its ability to capture the dynamics of systems that exhibit mean-reverting behavior, which is common in many natural processes.\n\n### Significance of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Process\n\n1. **Mean Reversion**: The OU process is characterized by its tendency to revert to a long-term mean. This property is particularly useful in modeling systems where fluctuations around a stable equilibrium are expected, such as in the evolution of phases in materials or in financial markets.\n\n2. **Stochastic Dynamics**: The OU process incorporates both deterministic and stochastic elements. It has a drift term that pulls the process towards a mean and a diffusion term that introduces randomness. This combination allows for a more realistic representation of systems that are influenced by both predictable trends and random perturbations.\n\n3. **Applications in Phase Evolution**: In the context of phase evolution, the OU process can model how a system transitions between different phases under the influence of noise. For example, in materials science, it can describe how a material's phase might fluctuate around a stable state due to thermal noise or other external factors.\n\n4. **Analytical Tractability**: The OU process has well-defined mathematical properties, making it analytically tractable. This allows researchers to derive important statistical properties, such as the autocorrelation function and the stationary distribution, which can be useful for understanding the long-term behavior of the system.\n\n### Comparison to a Simple Linear Ramp Approach\n\n1. **Deterministic vs. Stochastic**: A simple linear ramp approach is deterministic, meaning it assumes a constant rate of change over time without any randomness. In contrast, the OU process incorporates stochastic elements, allowing for fluctuations around the mean trajectory. This makes the OU process more suitable for systems where uncertainty and variability are inherent.\n\n2. **Behavior Over Time**: A linear ramp will lead to a predictable and linear progression towards a target phase, while the OU process allows for oscillations around a mean value. This can be more representative of real-world systems where external factors cause deviations from a simple linear trend.\n\n3. **Flexibility in Modeling**: The OU process can adapt to different scenarios by adjusting parameters such as the mean reversion speed and the intensity of the noise. In contrast, a linear ramp is less flexible and may not capture the complexities of phase evolution in systems influenced by random perturbations.\n\n4. **Long-Term Dynamics**: The OU process can exhibit rich long-term dynamics, including stationary distributions and correlations, which are not captured by a simple linear ramp. This can be crucial for understanding the stability and transitions of phases over extended periods.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process is a powerful tool for modeling phase evolution in stochastic systems due to its mean-reverting properties and ability to incorporate randomness. It provides a more nuanced and realistic framework compared to a simple linear ramp approach, which may oversimplify the dynamics of systems influenced by noise and variability. The choice between these models depends on the specific characteristics of the system being studied and the nature of the phase transitions involved.", "gpt4o_mini_score": 9, "marvel_standard_answer": "The Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process is significant in stochastic modeling of phase evolution as it captures mean-reverting behavior and random fluctuations, providing a more realistic model compared to a simple linear ramp approach. \n</ANSWER>\n\n**Note:** This is a quick response generated by a language model, which may contain inaccuracies. \n                                                    For more detailed answers, please rephrase your question and be sure to request sources and supporting documents.\n                                                    ", "marvel_standard_score": 7, "marvel_deepsearch_answer": "The Significance of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Process in Stochastic Modeling of Phase Evolution\n\n====================================================================================\n\nThe Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) stochastic process, denoted as \n𝑥\n𝑡\nx\nt\n\t​\n\n, is a Gaussian stochastic process that plays a major role in the analysis of the evolution of phenotypic traits along phylogenies. It satisfies a stochastic differential equation and is utilized in mathematical models of evolving neural decisions.\n\nDefinition and Applications\n\nA stochastic process is a mapping \nΩ\n×\n𝑇\n→\n𝑅\n𝑛\nΩ×T→R\nn\n, where \nΩ\nΩ represents the set of all possible outcomes and \n𝑇\nT represents time. The Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process can be viewed as a collection of possible functions of time, and once an outcome \n𝜔\nω is selected, it predetermines a specific trajectory or sample path over time. The significance of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process in stochastic modeling of phase evolution can be inferred from its application in modeling evolving neural decisions [1].\n\nThe Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process has applications in physics [2] and electrical engineering [3], as discussed in various publications. For instance, it is used as a model of a low-pass filtered white noise [4].

The asymptotic phase for this process has been derived and studied [5]. Additionally, the OU process is used in stochastic modeling with adaptive dynamics to balance exploration and exploitation during learning, driven by deviations from error [6].\n\nThe Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process is described by the stochastic differential equation \n𝑑\n𝑋\n𝑡\n=\ndX\nt\n\t​\n\n=\\theta(\\mu\n−\n𝑋\n𝑡\n)\n𝑑\n𝑡\n+\n𝜎\n𝑑\n𝑊\n𝑡\n−X\nt\n\t​\n\n)dt+σdW\nt\n\t​\n\n, where \n𝜃\nθ, \n𝜇\nμ, and \n𝜎\nσ are parameters, and \n𝑊\n𝑡\nW\nt\n\t​\n\n is a Wiener process.

The Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process is used in the Vasicek model of the interest rate, and is one of several approaches used to model interest rates, currency exchange rates, and commodity prices stochastically. It is also used in other financial models, such as the Stein and Stein model, and Heston's model.\n\nApplications in Finance and Other Fields\n\nThe Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process is used in phylogenetic comparative analysis to detect adaptive evolution [7].

In the context of the misaligned model with parameters \\( n_\\theta = 2 \\) and \\( z = 2 \\times 10^{-4} \\), we can interpret the implications of these parameters on the spin distribution of the remnants.\n\n1. **Misaligned Model with \\( n_\\theta = 2 \\)**: \n   - The parameter \\( n_\\theta = 2 \\) suggests a specific distribution of the misalignment angles between the spins of the binary components and the orbital angular momentum. A higher value of \\( n_\\theta \\) typically indicates a more significant spread in the misalignment angles, leading to a diverse range of spin orientations for the resulting remnants.\n   - The metallicity parameter \\( z = 2 \\times 10^{-4} \\) indicates a low metallicity environment, which can affect the mass loss during stellar evolution and the formation of black holes. Low metallicity stars tend to retain more mass and can lead to more massive remnants.\n\n2. **Comparison to Completely Misaligned Binary Model with \\( n_\\theta = 0 \\)**:\n   - In the completely misaligned binary model with \\( n_\\theta = 0 \\), the spins of the remnants are aligned with the orbital angular momentum, leading to a more uniform spin distribution. This model typically results in remnants that have spins that are either very low or aligned, as the spins do not experience significant precession or misalignment effects.\n   - The comparison between the two models indicates that the \\( n_\\theta = 2 \\) model would produce a broader and potentially more complex spin distribution for the remnants. This could lead to a higher fraction of rapidly spinning black holes or neutron stars, as the misalignment can enhance the spin-up mechanisms during the merger process.\n\n3. **Implications for Observations**:\n   - The differences in spin distributions between the two models can have significant implications for gravitational wave observations. A broader spin distribution in the \\( n_\\theta = 2 \\) model may lead to different merger rates and characteristics in the gravitational wave signals compared to the \\( n_\\theta = 0 \\) model.\n   - Additionally, the remnant mass distribution may also differ, with the \\( n_\\theta = 2 \\) model potentially producing more massive remnants due to the effects of low metallicity and the dynamics of misaligned spins.\n\nIn summary, the remnant mass spin distribution in the misaligned model with \\( n_\\theta = 2 \\) and low metallicity suggests a more diverse and potentially higher-spin population of remnants compared to the completely misaligned model with \\( n_\\theta = 0 \\).

This model is characterized by a mildly misaligned configuration ($n_\\theta = 2$) and low metallicity ($z = 2 \\times 10^{-4}$). The stellar evolution recipe used constitutes a crucial ingredient in calculating black hole natal mass and, consequently, remnant masses. When comparing this to the completely misaligned binary model with $n_\\theta = 0$ at solar metallicities ($z = 0.02$), there is a difference in the predicted remnant black hole masses. The model with $n_\\theta = 2$ and $z = 2 \\times 10^{-4}$ produces much more massive black holes, especially at low metallicities. The $m_{\\rm rem} - a_{\\rm rem}$ distribution for the misaligned isolated binary at low metallicity is significantly affected by the large black hole natal mass. The effect of varying $n_\\theta$ on the remnant mass spin distribution in the misaligned model at low metallicities can be understood by comparing results obtained with mildly misaligned configurations ($n_\\theta = 2$) and $n_\\theta = 0$. This comparison indicates that $n_\\theta$ influences the distribution, with different stellar evolution codes ($\\sseet$ and $\\ssevn$) producing varying results, especially at low metallicities. For instance, $\\ssevn$ predicts more massive black holes, peaking at $\\gtrsim 90 - 100 M_\\odot$. The specific effects can be inferred from figures in the documents, such as Figure 7 in the article available at [@\"url:https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/482/3/2991/5128518\"] and Figure~\\ref{observed2} in [@\"url:https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/1806.01285.pdf\"]. The remnant mass spin distributions for both models can be found in [1] and [2]. The study \"Pathways for producing binary black holes with large misaligned spins in the isolated formation channel\" published in Phys. Rev. D provides the remnant mass spin distribution for both models at solar metallicities [1]. A figure depicting the remnant mass spin distribution for both models is also available [2]. The impact of metallicity on the remnant mass spin distribution in the misaligned model with $n_\\theta = 2$ and $z = 2 \\times 10^{-4}$ compared to solar metallicities is that low metallicity leads to more massive BHs, with a remnant BH mass peaking at $\\gtrsim 90 - 100 M_\\odot$, whereas solar metallicities result in a different distribution. This is supported by the $\\ssevn$ model, which produces much more massive BHs at low metallicities. The completely misaligned binary model with $n_\\theta = 0$ at solar metallicities results in a constrained lower mass source. In contrast, the misaligned model with $n_\\theta = 2$ and $z = 2 \\times 10^{-4}$ produces more massive black holes, especially at low metallicities, with remnant black hole masses peaking at $\\gtrsim 90 - 100 M_\\odot$. The difference in predicted outcomes between stellar evolution codes $\\sseet$ and $\\ssevn$ is also notable, with $\\ssevn$ predicting a higher degree of misalignment and larger metallicities to achieve overlap with observations. The remnant mass spin distribution for the misaligned model with parameters $n_\\theta =2$ and $z =2\\times10^{-4}$ indicates a remnant black hole mass peaking at $\\gtrsim90 -100 M_\\odot$. This model is characterized by a mildly misaligned configuration ($n_\\theta =2$) and low metallicity ($z =2 \\times10^{-4}$). The stellar evolution recipe used constitutes a crucial ingredient in calculating black hole natal mass and, consequently, remnant masses. When comparing this to the completely misaligned binary model with $n_\\theta =0$ at solar metallicities ($z =0.02$), there is a difference in the predicted remnant black hole masses. The model with $n_\\theta =2$ and $z =2 \\times10^{-4}$ produces much more massive black holes, especially at low metallicities. The $m_{\\rm rem} - a_{\\rm rem}$ distribution for the misaligned isolated binary at low metallicity is significantly affected by the large black hole natal mass. The impact of metallicity on the remnant black hole mass distribution in the misaligned model with $n_\\theta =2$ and $z =2 \\times10^{-4}$ is not directly stated in the provided documents. However, as metallicity $Z$ increases, the dimensionless spin $\\chi_B$ of a star increases because the stellar radius $R$ increases. This might suggest that metallicity has an indirect effect on the properties of black holes formed from such stars.\nREFERENCES\n\n<TASK_OUTPUT>\n\n[1] Phys. Rev.

These metrics provide insights into how well an organization is achieving its goals and help identify areas for improvement. In this article, we will explore different performance metrics, focusing on the concept of a \"global performance metric\" and its significance in various contexts.\n\n## Defining Global Performance Metric\n------------------------------------\n\nThe global performance metric is defined as \"the number of accurate predictions over a long period\" for a predictor. This metric is mentioned in NIST SP800-90B and provides a straightforward description of performance over time. [^1]\n\n## Performance Metrics in Human Resources\n-----------------------------------------\n\nIn human resources, performance metrics include:\n- **Employee Net Promoter Score (eNPS)**: calculated as the percentage of employee survey promoters minus percentage of survey detractors.\n- **Internal promotions vs. external hires**: measured as the ratio of internal promotions to external hires.\n- **Employee retention rate**: calculated as $\\frac{Number\\ of\\ employees\\ at\\ the\\ end\\ of\\ a\\ period\\ -\\ Number\\ of\\ new\\ employees\\ hired}{Number\\ of\\ employees\\ at\\ the\\ start} \\times100$.\n- **Net promoter score (NPS)**: calculated as the percentage of survey promoters minus percentage of survey detractors.\n\nThese metrics assess various aspects of a company's performance, including employee satisfaction, internal promotions, and employee retention. [^2]\n\n## Operational and Financial Performance Metrics\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nOperational and financial performance metrics include:\n- **Throughput**: calculated as Total number of goods produced / specified time frame.\n- **On-time delivery**: measured as Number of products delivered on time / total number of products delivered.\n- **Rate-of-return merchandise authorizations (RMAs)**: expressed as $(Number of RMAs / number of orders delivered) \\times100$.\n- **Employee satisfaction rate**: calculated as $(Total number of employees who rank themselves satisfied / total number of responses) \\times100$.\n- **Employee turnover**: measured as $(Employees who leave during specified time / average number of employees during that time) \\times100$.\n\nThese metrics can measure financial performance, such as operating cash flow ratio, or operational performance, such as mean time to repair. [^3]\n\n## System Performance Metrics\n---------------------------\n\nSystem performance metrics include:\n- **Average Response Time**: measures how long, on average, the system takes to respond to requests.\n- **Standard Deviation**: indicates how much response times fluctuate from the average.\n- **Percentiles (p90, p95, p99)**: show response time thresholds for most users.\n- **Requests Per Second**: quantifies the number of requests the system can handle.\n- **Error Rate**: tracks the percentage of failed requests.\n\nNo single \"global performance metric\" is explicitly mentioned, but rather a collection of metrics used for performance evaluation. [^4]\n\n## Sales Performance Metrics\n-------------------------\n\nSales performance metrics include:\n- **Number of contracts signed per quarter**\n- **Dollar value for new contracts signed per period**\n- **Close rate**: calculated as $Close\\ rate = \\frac{number\\ of\\ closed\\ contracts}{sales\\ qualified\\ leads}$.\n\nSpecifically, the global performance metric can be evaluated using measures such as close rate, market share, and Net Promoter Score (NPS). [^5]\n\n## Database Performance Metrics\n-----------------------------\n\nDatabase performance metrics include:\n- **query_cache_hit_rate**: calculated as $\\frac{Qcache_hits}{QCache_hits$ + Com_select} \\times100$.\n- **innodb_datafile_writes_to_disk**: calculated as $Innodb_data_writes - Innodb_log_writes - Innodb_dblwr_writes$.\n\nThese metrics collectively contribute to understanding the database's performance, but there is no explicit mention of a \"global performance metric.\" [^6]\n\n## Global Summary Metric\n-----------------------\n\nThe global summary metric displays the aggregate value for all periods in the time series and is used to understand overall performance or magnitude. It can be represented by the equation $Global\\ Summary = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} Metric\\ Values_{i}$, where n is the total number of periods in the time series. [^7]\n\nIn conclusion, performance metrics are essential for evaluating the success of various aspects of an organization. Understanding the concept of a global performance metric and its significance in different contexts can help organizations make informed decisions and drive improvement.\n\n[^1]: [https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/global_performance_metric](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/global_performance_metric)\n[^2]: [https://technologyadvice.com/blog/human-resources/performance-metrics-examples/](https://technologyadvice.com/blog/human-resources/performance-metrics-examples/)\n[^3]: [https://www.netsuite.com/portal/resource/articles/business-strategy/performance-metrics.shtml](https://www.netsuite.com/portal/resource/articles/business-strategy/performance-metrics.shtml)\n[^4]: [https://abstracta.us/blog/performance-testing/performance-testing-metrics/](https://abstracta.us/blog/performance-testing/performance-testing-metrics/)\n[^5]: [https://onstrategyhq.com/resources/27-examples-of-key-performance-indicators/](https://onstrategyhq.com/resources/27-examples-of-key-performance-indicators/)\n[^6]: [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_PerfInsights_Counters.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_PerfInsights_Counters.html)\n[^7]: [https://help.sigmacomputing.com/docs/build-a-kpi-chart](https://help.sigmacomputing.com/docs/build-a-kpi-chart)", "marvel_standard_score": 8, "marvel_deepsearch_answer": "The performance metrics represented by the values in the table, specifically focusing on the global performance metric, are:\n\nGlobal Performance Metric as defined by NIST SP800-90B: \"the number of accurate predictions over a long period\" for a predictor.\nGlobal Summary as described in Document7: \n𝐺\n𝑙\n𝑜\n𝑏\n𝑎\n𝑙\n \n𝑆\n𝑢\n𝑚\n𝑚\n𝑎\n𝑟\n𝑦\n=\n∑\n𝑖\n=\n1\n𝑛\n𝑀\n𝑒\n𝑡\n𝑟\n𝑖\n𝑐\n \n𝑉\n𝑎\n𝑙\n𝑢\n𝑒\n𝑠\n𝑖\nGlobal Summary=∑\ni=1\nn\n\t​\n\nMetric Values\ni\n\t​\n\n, where n is the total number of periods in the time series.\nClose Rate, Market Share, and Net Promoter Score (NPS) mentioned in Document5 as measures to evaluate global performance.\n\nThe most directly relevant and recent definition of a global performance metric seems to be provided in Document1 and Document7.

In many models, the mass fraction is expected to be distributed in a way that reflects the observed structures and dynamics of the universe.\n\nHowever, some sequence models, particularly those that attempt to explain the formation and evolution of galaxies or the large-scale structure of the universe, may predict mass fractions that are unphysically large. This can occur due to several reasons:\n\n1. **Overestimation of Dark Matter**: Some models may predict a higher mass fraction of dark matter than what is observed. This can lead to discrepancies when comparing model predictions with observational data, such as galaxy rotation curves or gravitational lensing measurements.\n\n2. **Baryonic Mass Fraction**: In certain models, the baryonic (normal matter) mass fraction may be overestimated, especially in regions where star formation is not as efficient as predicted. This can lead to an unrealistic representation of the mass distribution in galaxies.\n\n3. **Feedback Mechanisms**: Many sequence models incorporate feedback mechanisms from supernovae and active galactic nuclei (AGN) to regulate star formation and gas inflow. If these feedback processes are not accurately modeled, it can result in an unphysically large mass fraction in stars or gas.\n\n4. **Cosmological Simulations**: Simulations that attempt to model the formation of large-scale structures may also yield mass fractions that do not align with observations. For instance, if the simulations do not adequately account for the effects of baryonic physics, they may predict an excessive amount of mass in certain components.\n\nEvidence suggesting that these models accommodate an unphysically large mass fraction can come from:\n\n- **Observational Discrepancies**: Direct measurements of mass in galaxies (e.g., through gravitational lensing or dynamical studies) may show that the mass fractions predicted by models are significantly higher than what is observed.\n\n- **Galaxy Scaling Relations**: Relations such as the Tully-Fisher relation or the fundamental plane of elliptical galaxies may not hold if the mass fractions are incorrectly estimated, indicating that the models do not accurately reflect the underlying physics.\n\n- **Comparative Studies**: Studies comparing different models and their predictions against observational data can highlight inconsistencies, particularly when certain models consistently predict higher mass fractions than others.\n\nIn summary, while sequence models provide valuable insights into the mass distribution in astrophysical systems, discrepancies between model predictions and observational data can indicate that some models may accommodate unphysically large mass fractions.", "gpt4o_mini_score": 8, "marvel_standard_answer": "<QUERY> What is the expected mass fraction across sequence models, and what evidence suggests that it accommodates an unphysically large mass fraction? </QUERY>\n\nAfter carefully reading through the provided text documents, I found several mentions of \"mass fraction\" in different contexts. Here's a summary of the findings:\n\n*   **Document2**: The expected mass fraction across sequence models can be inferred from various mass model results and actual data.

Several experts have shared their opinions on this topic, which are summarized below.\n\n## Introduction\n---------------\n\nThe mass fraction in the hydrogen-exhausted core of stars is a crucial parameter in understanding their evolution. According to [Iben, 1967](https://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1967ARA%26A...5..571I), the mass fraction in the hydrogen-exhausted core reaches values predicted by current evolutionary models of mass near $5M_{\\odot}$.\n\n## Mass Fraction in Stellar Evolution Models\n-----------------------------------------\n\nThe mass fraction of metals, Z, can be related to the iron abundance, [Fe/H], through equations such as $Z = Z_{\\odot} \\times10^{[Fe/H]}$, where $Z_{\\odot}$ is the solar metallicity. A study referenced on [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/X-Y-and-Z-mass-fractions-adopted-for-the-models-and-the-corre-spondent-Fe-H-values_tbl2_332556893) provides up-to-date stellar evolution tracks from PARSEC and FRANEC, which likely include a range of mass fractions.\n\n## Mass Fraction in Cosmology and Galaxy Evolution\n------------------------------------------------\n\nRecent works use machine learning tools such as cINN and random forest to study the merger history of galaxies by combining various parameters including stellar mass, stellar populations, and a few morphological parameters [A&A, 2025](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2025/03/aa52772-24/aa52772-24.html). These models predict ex situ stellar mass fractions well with a typical scatter of ∼0.1 compared to the ground truth with enough input information.\n\n## Evidence for Unphysically Large Mass Fractions\n------------------------------------------------\n\nThere is evidence to suggest that some models may accommodate an unphysically large mass fraction. For instance, a study published in [NASA's Technical Reports Server](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20150016561/downloads/20150016561.pdf) mentions that Equation (10) predicts a Delta IV CBC propellant mass fraction of $0.82$, starting with Atlas V's $0.93$, which may be too high.\n\n## Mass Fraction in Different Contexts\n--------------------------------------\n\nThe expected mass fraction across sequence models is estimated to be up to $0.6$ in a study published in [PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6777711/), which analyzed datasets with $1000$ or more cross-links. In another context, the mass fraction of dense gas within giant molecular clouds (GMCs) of the Milky Way is investigated using $^{13}$CO data from the Five College Radio Astronomy [IOPscience, 2014](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/780/2/173).\n\n## Conclusion\n--------------\n\nIn conclusion, the expected mass fraction across sequence models varies depending on the context and field of study. While some models predict mass fractions with a typical scatter of ∼0.1, others suggest that some models may accommodate unphysically large mass fractions. Further research is needed to understand the implications of these findings.\n\n## References\n--------------\n\n* [Iben, 1967](https://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1967ARA%26A...5..571I)\n* [A&A, 2025](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2025/03/aa52772-24/aa52772-24.html)\n* [NASA's Technical Reports Server](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20150016561/downloads/20150016561.pdf)\n* [PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6777711/)\n* [IOPscience, 2014](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/780/2/173)", "marvel_standard_score": 7, "marvel_deepsearch_answer": "The expected mass fraction across sequence models varies across different studies and contexts.\n\nA mass fraction of \n0.887\n0.887 is published, and a more complete mass model computes a \n0.884\n0.884 mass fraction for Delta IV, compared to an actual value of \n0.882\n0.882.

In the context of gravitational waves (GWs), particularly those produced by binary systems, the predictions regarding polarization can differ from those of General Relativity (GR).\n\nIn GR, gravitational waves are predicted to have two polarizations, often referred to as \"plus\" and \"cross\" polarizations (denoted as \\(h_+\\) and \\(h_\\times\\)). However, in modified theories like the massless Horndeski theory, additional degrees of freedom can lead to the possibility of extra polarizations. Specifically, the presence of a scalar field can introduce a scalar polarization mode, which is not present in GR. This scalar mode can affect the propagation and polarization of gravitational waves, potentially leading to observable differences in the signals detected by gravitational wave observatories.\n\nPulsar timing arrays (PTAs) are a powerful tool for detecting gravitational waves, particularly in the low-frequency regime (nanohertz frequencies). PTAs utilize the precise timing of pulsar signals to measure variations in the arrival times of these signals caused by passing gravitational waves. When a gravitational wave passes through the Earth, it distorts spacetime, leading to changes in the distance between the Earth and the pulsar, which can be detected as timing residuals.\n\nIn the context of massless Horndeski theory, PTAs can be used to search for signatures of the additional polarization modes. By analyzing the timing residuals of multiple pulsars, researchers can look for correlations that would indicate the presence of scalar polarizations or deviations from the expected GR behavior. If the gravitational waves exhibit additional polarizations, this could manifest as distinct patterns in the timing residuals, allowing for the potential detection of modified gravity effects.\n\nIn summary, the massless Horndeski theory predicts the possibility of additional polarization modes for gravitational waves, and pulsar timing arrays can be utilized to search for these signatures by analyzing the timing of pulsar signals for deviations from the predictions of General Relativity.

Pulsar timing arrays can be utilized to detect the extra polarizations in these theories, particularly because they are sensitive to lower frequencies where the longitudinal and transverse modes have similar amplitudes.\n\nReferences:\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1806.04027\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/2218-1997/4/8\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/326874881_The_Polarizations_of_Gravitational_Waves.pdf\nThe European Physical Journal C, Volume78, Issue5, article id.378,15 pp.\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.01899.pdf\nhttps://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjc/s10052-025-14412-6\nhttps://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjc/s10052-018-5869-y\nhttps://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/401/4/2372/1125899\nhttps://nanograv.org/sites/default/files/2022-11/Astro2020_Paper4_0.pdf\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.98.104017\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/326799691_Gravitational_waves_and_the_polarizations_in_Hovrava_gravity_after_GW170817\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/328948295_Gravitational_waves_and_the_polarizations_in_Horava_gravity_after_GW170817 </TASK_OUTPUT>\nREFERENCES\n\n<TASK_OUTPUT>\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1806.04027\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/2218-1997/4/8\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/326874881_The_Polarizations_of_Gravitational_Waves.pdf\nThe European Physical Journal C, Volume78, Issue5, article id.378,15 pp.\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.01899.pdf\nhttps://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjc/s10052-025-14412-6\nhttps://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjc/s10052-018-5869-y\nhttps://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/401/4/2372/1125899\nhttps://nanograv.org/sites/default/files/2022-11/Astro2020_Paper4_0.pdf\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.98.104017\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.109.104054\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.99.063002\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.110.043501\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.110.103505\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211379724004029\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/326799691_Gravitational_waves_and_the_polarizations_in_Hovrava_gravity_after_GW170817\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/328948295_Gravitational_waves_and_the_polarizations_in_Horava_gravity_after_GW170817 </TASK_OUTPUT>", "marvel_deepsearch_score": 9, "evaluation_model_type": "openai", "evaluation_model_name": "gpt-4o-mini", "qa_model_type": "openai", "qa_model_name": "gpt-4o-mini", "gpt4o_mini_answer_relevancy": 0.92, "gpt4o_mini_answer_correctness": 0.9, "gpt4o_mini_faithfulness": 0.85, "marvel_standard_answer_relevancy": 0.9, "marvel_standard_answer_correctness": 0.9, "marvel_standard_faithfulness": 0.9, "marvel_deepsearch_answer_relevancy": 0.95, "marvel_deepsearch_answer_correctness": 0.98, "marvel_deepsearch_faithfulness": 0.92}

Here’s a breakdown of how these factors influence each other:\n\n### 1. **Metallicity and Stellar Evolution:**\n- **Low Metallicity:** Stars formed in environments with low metallicity (i.e., lower abundance of elements heavier than helium) tend to have different evolutionary paths compared to their higher metallicity counterparts. Low metallicity affects:\n  - **Stellar Winds:** Stars with low metallicity experience weaker stellar winds. This is because stellar winds are driven by radiation pressure on metal lines; with fewer metals, the winds are less efficient. As a result, low-metallicity stars retain more of their mass over their lifetimes.\n  - **Mass Loss:** The reduced mass loss leads to a higher retention mass, which can influence the final mass of the star when it ends its life.\n\n### 2. **Formation Redshift:**\n- **Higher Formation Redshift:** Stars that form at higher redshifts (earlier in the universe's history) are often in environments that are also low in metallicity. The conditions in the early universe favored the formation of massive stars, which can evolve into black holes.\n  - **Massive Progenitors:** Higher formation redshifts are associated with the formation of more massive stars, which can lead to the formation of black holes. These massive stars evolve quickly and can end their lives as supernovae, leaving behind black holes.\n  - **Initial Mass Function (IMF):** The IMF may be top-heavy in low-metallicity environments, meaning that a larger fraction of stars are massive. This can lead to a higher number of black holes being formed.\n\n### 3. **Retention Mass Evolution:**\n- **Impact on Black Hole Formation:** The retention mass of a star is crucial for determining whether it will end its life as a neutron star or a black hole. If a star retains more mass due to low metallicity and weak stellar winds, it is more likely to evolve into a black hole rather than a neutron star.\n- **Final Mass of Black Holes:** The final mass of black holes formed from low-metallicity stars can be higher than those formed from higher metallicity stars due to the increased retention of mass during their evolution.\n\n### 4. **Cosmological Implications:**\n- **Population of Black Holes:** The combination of low metallicity and high formation redshift can lead to a population of black holes that are more massive than those formed in later, higher metallicity environments. This has implications for the growth of supermassive black holes in the centers of galaxies and the overall structure of the universe.\n- **Gravitational Wave Events:** The formation of massive black holes in low-metallicity environments may also influence the rates and characteristics of gravitational wave events from black hole mergers.\n\n### Conclusion:\nIn summary, low metallicities and higher formation redshifts contribute to the retention mass evolution of stellar progenitors by reducing mass loss through stellar winds and favoring the formation of more massive stars. This, in turn, influences the formation of black holes, leading to a potentially higher population of massive black holes in the early universe.

Recent studies have shed light on the impact of low metallicities and higher formation redshifts on the retention mass evolution of stellar progenitors and the formation of black holes.\n\nMetallicity and Black Hole Formation\n\nLow metallicity environments play a crucial role in the formation of black holes. In these environments, mass loss due to stellar winds is minimal, allowing binaries to retain their tight separation throughout their evolution, and consequently, the final black holes are close enough for GW emission to drive a merger within the lifetime of the Universe [1]. Additionally, low mass loss means the stars preserve a large fraction of their initial angular momentum. Chemically homogeneous massive stars remain compact, evolve into helium stars, and may later collapse into black holes.\n\nThe Role of Redshift\n\nHigher formation redshifts also have a significant impact on black hole formation. Studies have shown that the influence of low metallicities and higher formation redshifts on the retention mass evolution of stellar progenitors and the formation of black holes is notable [2]. Specifically, it is found that the number of binary black hole (BHB) mergers per unit mass is \n∼\n10\n−\n4\n𝑀\n⊙\n−\n1\n∼10\n−4\nM\n⊙\n−1\n\t​\n\n at low metallicities [3].\n\nStellar Evolution and Black Hole Formation\n\nThe evolution of massive stars is also affected by metallicity and redshift. For example, a \n33\n \n𝑀\n⊙\n33M\n⊙\n\t​\n\n black hole (BH) was recently discovered in an11.6-year binary only590 pc from the Sun [4]. The system, Gaia BH3, contains a \n0.8\n \n𝑀\n⊙\n0.8M\n⊙\n\t​\n\n low-metallicity giant (\\rm $$M/H$$=-2.2) that is a member of the ED-2 stellar stream. This discovery highlights the importance of considering metallicity and redshift in the formation of black holes.\n\nSpecific Astrophysical Mechanisms\n\nThe specific astrophysical mechanisms linking low metallicities and high formation redshifts to enhanced black hole formation and altered stellar progenitor evolution include:\n\nLow Metallicity and High Redshift Conditions: \n𝑇\n𝑣\n𝑖\n𝑟\n>\n10\n4\n𝐾\nT\nvir\n\t​\n\n>10\n4\nK, \n𝑧\n≳\n10\nz≳10, and \n𝑍\n∼\n10\n−\n5\n𝑍\n⊙\nZ∼10\n−5\nZ\n⊙\n\t​\n\n facilitate the formation of black hole seeds [5].\nAtomic Hydrogen Cooling: Contributes to gas cooling.\nUV Field Created by First Stars: Affects \n𝐻\n2\nH\n2\n\t​\n\n dissociation and gas cooling.\nMild Metal Pollution: Influences gas cooling and fragmentation.\nStellar-Dynamical Processes: Play a role in the formation of massive black holes in early stellar clusters.\nBinarity, Metallicity, Angular Momentum, and Magnetic Fields: Influence stellar progenitor evolution and black hole formation efficiency.\nSimulations and Observations\n\nSimulations have also been used to study the influence of low metallicities and higher formation redshifts on black hole formation. For example, the COLIBRE simulations investigate how low metallicities and higher formation redshifts influence the retention mass evolution of stellar progenitors and the formation of black holes [6]. These simulations include a multiphase interstellar medium, radiative cooling rates coupled to a model for the evolution of dust grains, and prescriptions for stellar and AGN feedback calibrated to reproduce the z=0 observed GSMF and stellar mass – size relation.\n\nThe Relative Contributions of Low Metallicity and High Redshift\n\nThe relative contributions of low metallicity and high redshift to the observed enhancements in black hole formation and stellar progenitor evolution are significant. Low metallicity environments facilitate the formation of more massive black holes by allowing for weaker stellar winds and more massive supernova progenitors that collapse directly into black holes. High redshift, associated with the early Universe, also plays a crucial role, as it corresponds to a period when metal-poor stars and high-redshift galaxies were more common, thereby enhancing black hole formation and stellar progenitor evolution.\n\nKey Differences in Stellar Progenitor Evolution and Black Hole Formation\n\nThe key differences in stellar progenitor evolution and black hole formation between low-metallicity, high-redshift galaxies and their high-metallicity, low-redshift counterparts are as follows:\n\nMassive stars in low-metallicity, high-redshift galaxies produce weaker stellar winds, leading to the formation of more massive black holes.\nLow-metallicity environments favor the formation of more compact binaries, potentially leading to more massive black hole mergers.\nHigh-metallicity, low-redshift galaxies produce lower-mass binary black hole mergers due to the evolution of dense star clusters in these environments.\nThe stellar progenitor evolution differs, with implications for the types of supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, and gravitational wave events observed in these galaxies.\nAdditional Insights\n\nFurther studies have provided additional insights into the influence of low metallicities and higher formation redshifts on the retention mass evolution of stellar progenitors and the formation of black holes. For example, starburst galaxies, which are more common at high redshift, might constitute \n∼\n16\n%\n∼16% of total galaxies at redshifts \n2\n<\n𝑧\n<\n3\n2<z<3. These galaxies typically exhibit lower metallicity, which could lead to an increase in the SFR at low metallicity [7].\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, low metallicities and higher formation redshifts have a significant impact on the retention mass evolution of stellar progenitors and the formation of black holes. The specific astrophysical mechanisms linking low metallicities and high formation redshifts to enhanced black hole formation and altered stellar progenitor evolution involve various double compact object formation channels.\n\nReferences\n\n[1] https://arxiv.org/html/2509.00154v1 [2] https://www.researchgate.net/publication/367598720_The_Effect_of_Metallicity_on_the_Formation_of_Massive_Black_Holes_through_Stellar_Collisions_in_Young_Massive_Star_Clusters [3] https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/474/3/2959/4628068 [4] https://astro.theoj.org/article/117652-on-the-formation-of-a-33-solar-mass-black-hole-in-a-low-metallicity-binary [5] https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/694/1/302.pdf [6] https://arxiv.org/html/2509.07960v1 [7] https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2025/08/aa54013-25/aa54013-25.html [8] https://arxiv.org/html/2502.07304v1 [9] https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/479/3/4056/5046730 [10] https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/512/3/3602/6549575 [11] https://arxiv.org/html/2507.07183v1 [12] https://arxiv.org/html/2407.12704v1 [13] https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad3ba8/epub [14] https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/442/4/3616/1359996 [15] https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ade791/epub [16] https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/533/2/1907/7722027 [17] https://arxiv.org/html/2507.01092 [18] https://astro.uni-bonn.de/~nlanger/thesis/dori.pdf [19] https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad0460 [20] https://arxiv.org/html/2508.14163v1\n\n</FINAL_DETAILED_REPORT>", "marvel_deepsearch_score": 8, "evaluation_model_type": "openai", "evaluation_model_name": "gpt-4o-mini", "qa_model_type": "openai", "qa_model_name": "gpt-4o-mini", "gpt4o_mini_answer_relevancy": 0.98, "gpt4o_mini_answer_correctness": 0.92, "gpt4o_mini_faithfulness": 0.05, "marvel_standard_answer_relevancy": 0.92, "marvel_standard_answer_correctness": 0.85, "marvel_standard_faithfulness": 0.92, "marvel_deepsearch_answer_relevancy": 0.98, "marvel_deepsearch_answer_correctness": 0.87, "marvel_deepsearch_faithfulness": 0.87}

Their initial mass can vary, but they are generally considered to have masses in the range of hundreds to thousands of solar masses.\n\n2. **Mass Growth Mechanisms**: IMBHs can grow in mass through several mechanisms:\n   - **Accretion**: They can accrete gas and dust from their surroundings, especially in regions of high density, such as the centers of galaxies.\n   - **Mergers**: IMBHs can merge with other black holes, leading to significant mass increases.\n   - **Star Capture**: They can capture stars that come too close, which can also contribute to their growth.\n\n3. **Galactic Center Mass**: The mass of the galactic center (often dominated by a supermassive black hole, SMBH) typically increases over cosmic time due to similar processes of accretion and mergers. The mass of the GC can be significantly larger than that of an IMBH, often reaching millions to billions of solar masses.\n\n4. **Evolution Redshift Ratio**: The evolution redshift (z) is a measure of how the universe has expanded since the formation of structures like galaxies and black holes. The growth of IMBHs relative to the mass of the GC can be influenced by the redshift, as different epochs in the universe's history have different conditions for star formation, gas availability, and merger rates.\n\n5. **Relationship**: The relationship can be summarized as follows:\n   - At higher redshifts (earlier times in the universe), conditions may favor the rapid growth of IMBHs due to abundant gas and star formation, potentially allowing them to grow more significantly relative to the mass of the GC.\n   - As the universe evolves and redshift decreases, the growth rates may change due to the availability of material and the dynamics of galaxy mergers, which can affect both IMBHs and GCs.\n   - The ratio of the mass of IMBHs to the mass of the GC may also depend on the specific formation history of the galaxy and the environment in which the IMBH formed.\n\nIn summary, the initial mass of IMBHs and their growth relative to the mass of the galactic center is a complex interplay influenced by cosmic evolution, environmental factors, and the mechanisms of mass accretion and mergers, all of which are modulated by the evolution redshift.", "gpt4o_mini_score": 8, "marvel_standard_answer": "<QUERY> What is the relationship between the initial mass of intermediate black holes (IMBH) and the growth of their mass compared to the mass of the galactic center (GC) as indicated by the evolution redshift ratio?.

IMBHs, with a mass range of $100–10^5 M_{\\odot}$, are predicted to be the seeds for supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the early universe, with SMBHs having a mass range of $10^6–10^{10} M_{\\odot}$.\n\n## Theoretical Models and Observations\n\nTheoretical models discuss the relationship between the initial mass of IMBHs and the growth of their mass compared to the mass of the GC, as indicated by the evolution redshift ratio ([https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/448/1/104/1751871](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/448/1/104/1751871)). These models predict that a population of IMBHs exists, and their mass growth can be influenced by accretion. For instance, a study shows that in the first panel, the black hole is accreting mass from the innermost region ([https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/448/1/104/1751871](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/448/1/104/1751871)).\n\n## Evolution of Star Clusters and IMBHs\n\nThe evolution of star clusters containing IMBHs of $300–5000 M ⊙$ is investigated, focusing on the formation and evolution of IMBHs ([https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adde52](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adde52)). The study of the redshift evolution of the relationship between SMBH and other black holes, specifically within the context of galaxies, provides statistical insights ([https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/531/1/851/7671153](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/531/1/851/7671153)).\n\n## Growth Mechanisms and Redshift Range\n\nThe growth mechanism of IMBHs may evolve with black hole mass as well as redshift, and future observations with the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will help understand whether gas accretion or mergers with other IMBHs are the predominant form of growth for SMBH seeds ([https://lisa.nasa.gov/downloads/forScientists/whitePapers/Where_IMBHs.pdf](https://lisa.nasa.gov/downloads/forScientists/whitePapers/Where_IMBHs.pdf)).

IMBHs, with a mass range of \n100\n–\n10\n5\n𝑀\n⊙\n100–10\n5\nM\n⊙\n\t​\n\n, are predicted to be the seeds for supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the early universe, with SMBHs having a mass range of \n10\n6\n–\n10\n10\n𝑀\n⊙\n10\n6\n–10\n10\nM\n⊙\n\t​\n\n.\n\nTheoretical Models and Observations\n\nTheoretical models discuss the relationship between the initial mass of IMBHs and the growth of their mass compared to the mass of the GC, as indicated by the evolution redshift ratio. These models predict that a population of IMBHs exists, and their mass growth can be influenced by accretion. For instance, a study shows that in the first panel, the black hole is accreting mass from the innermost region.\n\nThe evolution of star clusters containing IMBHs of \n300\n–\n5000\n𝑀\n⊙\n300–5000M⊙ is investigated, focusing on the formation and evolution of IMBHs. The study of the redshift evolution of the relationship between SMBH and other black holes, specifically within the context of galaxies, provides statistical insights.\n\nGrowth Mechanisms and Redshift Range\n\nThe growth mechanism of IMBHs may evolve with black hole mass as well as redshift, and future observations with the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will help understand whether gas accretion or mergers with other IMBHs are the predominant form of growth for SMBH seeds.\n\nThe expected range of mass ratios for IMBH-SMBH mergers is \n0.1\n0.1 up to \n10\n−\n8\n10\n−8\n, known as extreme or intermediate mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs or IMRIs).\n\nContribution to Supermassive Black Hole Growth\n\nThe contribution of IMBHs to the growth of supermassive black holes is considered, with the SMBH of the Milky Way (MW) theorized to form through such a process.\n\nThe redshift range varies with the host galaxy mass or GC metallicity, with many models assuming that metal-poor GCs formed in low-mass galaxies before the metal-rich ones.\n\nThe Evolution of Black Hole Mass Function and Its Influence on Intermediate Black Holes\n\nThe evolution of the black hole mass function at \n𝑧\n∼\n5\nz∼5 has been investigated using XQz5, a sample of the most luminous quasars between the redshifts \n4.5\n<\n𝑧\n<\n5.3\n4.5<z<5.3. The sample consists of 72 quasars with black hole masses estimated from velocity-broadened emission-line measurements and single-epoch virial prescriptions. The study found that the completeness-corrected mass function is modelled as a double power-law, and its evolution across redshift is constrained assuming accretion-dominated mass growth.\n\nInfluence of Evolution Redshift Ratio on IMBHs\n\nThe evolution redshift ratio's influence on the mass growth of IMBHs in comparison to the mass of the galactic center has been studied in various papers. These studies suggest that the main growth channel for black holes depends on the mass of the black hole and on redshift. In the nearby universe, small black holes grow mostly by accretion, while very big black holes grow mostly via mergers. However, in the very-far-away universe, there is a reversal: small black holes grow mostly by mergers, big black holes by accretion.\n\nGrowth of IMBHs in Galactic Centers\n\nThe growth of IMBHs in galactic centers has been studied using GRAVITY astrometric and SINFONI, KECK, and GNIRS spectroscopic data of S2. The study explored the possibility of a second massive object, an IMBH, being present in the form of a binary companion to SgrA*. The results suggest that IMBH masses \n>\n2000\n𝑀\n⊙\n>2000M\n⊙\n\t​\n\n on orbits with smaller semi-major axes than S2 are largely excluded.\n\nObservational Evidence\n\nObservational evidence for the growth of IMBHs has been found in the study of luminous quasars. The quasar, SDSS J092034.17+065718.0 (J0920), was observed using GRAVITY+ at the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI). The observations revealed a dynamical measurement of the black hole mass in the quasar 11 billion years ago. The study found that the black hole mass was undermassive compared to the host galaxy, suggesting a delay between galaxy and black hole formation for some systems.\n\nCorrelation Between Initial Mass and Growth Rate\n\nThe correlation between the initial mass of IMBHs and their mass growth rate as a function of redshift, specifically in relation to galactic center mass evolution, is an area of active research. While a comprehensive, quantitative answer is not available, the literature suggests that IMBHs are important for SMBH growth, with their mass growth rate influenced by initial mass, redshift, mergers, and accretion.\n\nIntroduction to Intermediate Black Holes\n\nIntermediate-mass black holes are thought to play a vital role in the growth of massive and supermassive black holes (BHs), and are thus closely linked to their evolution. The formation process of IMBHs, defined as those between \n10\n2\n10\n2\n and \n10\n5\n10\n5\n solar masses (\n𝑀\n⊙\nM\n⊙\n\t​\n\n), is debated.\n\nGrowth of Intermediate Black Holes\n\nThe growth in mass of stellar-mass black holes (BH) occurs through collisions with stars, where the mass increase can be as significant as the entire mass of the star if the relative velocities are appropriately aligned. Mergers of IMBHs can form a natural, albeit inefficient, path to forming supermassive black holes (SMBHs), given the ubiquity of mergers.\n\nSimulations and Models\n\nThe Renaissance simulations, a suite of three zoom-in regions of cosmological N-body, hydrodynamical simulations, have been used to study the correlation between the initial mass of IMBHs and their mass growth rate. These simulations model early galaxy formation, including Pop III and Pop II star formation and feedback, requiring high resolution to resolve (mini-)halos of masses \n∼\n10\n6\nM\n⊙\n∼10\n6\nM\n⊙\n\t​\n\n.\n\nRedshift Evolution of Supermassive Black Hole Mass Functions\n\nThe redshift evolution of supermassive black hole mass functions (BHMFs) has been investigated up to \n𝑧\n∼\n1\nz∼1. The Delphi semi-analytic model, which tracks the evolution of black holes and their host galaxies at \n𝑧\n>\n4\nz>4, has been used to study the mass assembly of high-redshift black holes.\n\nDetection of Intermediate-Mass Black Holes\n\nThe detection of an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) in the globular cluster ω Centauri, which has a mass of approximately \n8\n,\n200\n𝑀\n⊙\n8,200M\n⊙\n\t​\n\n, has been reported.\n\nAdditional Insights\n\nRecent studies have provided additional insights into the relationship between IMBHs and GC growth. For instance, https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2025/02/aa51672-24/aa51672-24.html discusses the role of IMBHs in the early universe, while https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/aaa775 explores the growth mechanisms of IMBHs.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the relationship between the initial mass of IMBHs and their growth compared to the mass of the GC is complex and influenced by various factors. The evolution redshift ratio plays a significant role in the mass growth of IMBHs. Future observations with LISA and detailed fits to state-of-the-art dynamical models will help understand the growth mechanisms of IMBHs and their contribution to the growth of supermassive black holes.\n\nReferences\nhttps://lisa.nasa.gov/downloads/forScientists/whitePapers/Where_IMBHs.pdf\nhttps://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/448/1/104/1751871\nhttps://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adde52\nhttps://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/531/1/851/7671153\nhttps://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-pdf/538/4/2255/62432128/staf445.pdf\nhttps://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/454/2/1658/1049913\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10721\nhttps://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4561239/\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04067\nhttps://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2024/04/aa48161-23/aa48161-23.html\nhttps://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/aaa775\nhttps://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/417/3/2085/1092272\nhttps://www.cfa.harvard.edu/news/scientists-shed-light-growth-black-holes\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07053-4\nhttps://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2025/02/aa51672-24/aa51672-24.html\nhttps://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/aae377\nhttps://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adi4211\nhttps://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ac6426\nhttps://arxiv.org/html/2409.16413v1\nhttps://inspirehep.net/literature/693724\nhttps://hal.science/hal-02973143v1/file/staa3363.pdf\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07511-z\n\n</FINAL_DETAILED_REPORT>", "marvel_deepsearch_score": 8, "evaluation_model_type": "openai", "evaluation_model_name": "gpt-4o-mini", "qa_model_type": "openai", "qa_model_name": "gpt-4o-mini", "gpt4o_mini_answer_relevancy": 0.87, "gpt4o_mini_answer_correctness": 0.8, "gpt4o_mini_faithfulness": 0.05, "marvel_standard_answer_relevancy": 0.98, "marvel_standard_answer_correctness": 0.8, "marvel_standard_faithfulness": 0.8, "marvel_deepsearch_answer_relevancy": 0.8, "marvel_deepsearch_answer_correctness": 0.0, "marvel_deepsearch_faithfulness": 0.8}

These events are detected by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) or Virgo detector and are denoted by a unique identifier, such as \"GW\" followed by the date and a letter (e.g., GW190514e). The sky localization and distance estimates for these events can be found in BAYESTAR and LALINFERENCE. BAYESTAR produces sky localizations with latencies of only a few seconds and provides distance estimates. LALINFERENCE constructs posterior probability distributions for the system parameters, including location and distance, with higher latency. The sky localization and distance estimates for gravitational wave events are crucial for multi-messenger follow-ups. Recent studies have focused on improving the capacity to infer the sky-localization of transient sources, enabling more effective follow-ups. The ability to localize the sources of the detected signals depends on the geographical distribution of the detectors and their relative sensitivity. Determining the sky position of a significant fraction of detected signals to areas of $5–20$ square degrees requires at least three detectors of sensitivity within a factor of $\\sim2$ of each other and with a broad frequency bandwidth. When all detectors, including KAGRA and the third LIGO detector in India, reach design sensitivity, a significant fraction of gravitational-wave signals will be localized to a few square degrees by gravitational-wave observations alone. The median sky localization area ($90\\%$ credible region) is expected to be a few hundreds of square degrees for all types of binary systems during O3 with the Advanced LIGO and Virgo (HLV) network. The median sky localization area will improve to a few tens of square degrees during O4 with the Advanced LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA (HLVK) network. During O3, the median localization volume ($90\\%$ credible region) is expected to be on the order of $10^5,10^6,10^7 Mpc^3$ for binary neutron star, neutron star–black hole, and binary black hole systems, respectively. The expansion and upgrade of the global network of ground-based gravitational wave detectors promises to improve our capacity to infer the sky-localization of transient sources, enabling more effective multi-messenger follow-ups. The increase in the signal-to-noise ratio of detected events allows for more precise estimates of the source parameters. Assuming a fixed LIGO configuration, the addition of the Virgo detector is beneficial to the sky localization starting from a binary neutron star horizon distance of $20$ Mpc and improves significantly from $40$ Mpc onwards for both a single and double LIGO detector network, reducing the inferred mean sky-area by up to $95\\%$. For gravitational wave events from the current run O3, about $16$ per cent (or $25$ per cent) should fall in sky regions observed by Gaia. These events, along with others, contribute to our understanding of the population properties of compact binary mergers. Astrophysical models predict that binaries with mass ratios similar to the events in question can form through several channels. However, these models suggest that such binaries are unlikely to have the observed properties. The study of these events can provide valuable insights into the formation and evolution of compact binaries. A recent study investigated the potential association between GW190514 and GW190521 as a hierarchical triple merger associated with ZTF19abanrhr, highlighting the complex interactions between compact binaries and the possibility of hierarchical mergers.

According to a recent paper on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00108), SkyPortal has been operating at scale for 2 years for the Zwicky Transient Facility Phase II community, with hundreds of users, containing tens of millions of time-domain sources, interacting with dozens of telescopes, and enabling community reporting.\n\n## Public Interface and Gravitational Wave Counterpart Candidates\n\nThe public interface provided by SkyPortal plays a crucial role in sharing follow-up observations and associated products, as well as triggering new observations on potential gravitational wave (GW) counterpart candidates. As described in a paper on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.10178.pdf), SkyPortal can process alerts associated with GW and γ-ray burst events, receiving them using PyGCN. Additionally, it can ingest optical alerts from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), processed by the Fink Broker, through the SkyPortal Fink Client.\n\n## Ingestion of Events and Localization\n\nThe public interface provided by SkyPortal is related to gravitational wave counterpart candidates, ingesting events from the International Gravitational-Wave Network (IGWN), gamma-ray burst events from Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM), and neutrinos from IceCube, with each `GcnEvent` associated with a set of `Localization`s. These `Localization`s are HEALPix-based maps containing the probability density as a function of sky location, represented in ISO8601 format. According to the [SkyPortal documentation](https://skyportal.io/docs/mma.html), this is achieved through a GCN (Gamma-ray Coordinates Network) configuration, which requires a server, client ID, client secret, and specific notice types.\n\n## Analysis Services and Data Interaction\n\nSkyPortal serves as a central place of record for astronomical data and as an interaction portal around such data, enabling the establishment of 3rd party analysis services that can be interacted with both programmatically and via the webapp. As described in the [SkyPortal documentation](https://skyportal.io/docs/analysis.html), data available to a user on a particular source can be sent externally for processing via a POST request, and the results of this processing are written back to SkyPortal asynchronously via a webhook.\n\n## Multi-Messenger Features and Future Developments\n\nWith the imminent re-start of the next-generation of gravitational wave detectors, SkyPortal includes dedicated multi-messenger features addressing rapid multi-messenger follow-up requirements, such as multi-telescope management, team/group organizing interfaces, and cross-matching of multi-messenger data streams with time-domain optical surveys. According to a recent paper on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00108), SkyPortal leverages ChatGPT large-language models (LLMs) to automatically generate and surface source-level human-readable summaries.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the public interface provided by SkyPortal plays a vital role in the discovery and follow-up of transient events, particularly in relation to gravitational wave counterpart candidates. With its ability to ingest events from various sources, provide localization, and enable analysis services, SkyPortal has become a powerful tool for astronomers and researchers.\n\n## References\n\n* [arXiv:2207.10178](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.10178.pdf)\n* [SkyPortal documentation: MMA](https://skyportal.io/docs/mma.html)\n* [SkyPortal documentation: Analysis](https://skyportal.io/docs/analysis.html)\n* [arXiv:2305.00108](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00108)", "marvel_standard_score": 9, "marvel_deepsearch_answer": "'what is the purpose of the public interface provided by skyportal in relation to gravitational wave counterpart candidates?.

According to various studies, the kick velocity imparted to a neutron star in a binary system affects the orbital parameters of the post-supernova system, particularly its eccentricity and the system's space [1](https://academic.oup.com/mnrasl/article/363/1/L71/952385).\n\n## Effects of Kick Distributions\nDifferent kick distributions can affect this correlation, as they impact the orbital parameters and the mass of the second-born NS. For instance, the adoption of kick velocities and directions inferred from Be X-ray binaries reproduces the two observed branches in the eccentricity–period plane of DNS systems [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.08857). The best-fit model, which assumes a classical isotropic Maxwellian kick distribution based on isolated pulsars, predicts that over $90\\%$ of binaries break apart, and the few systems that remain bound are predicted to have eccentricities higher than the ones observed.\n\n## Implications for DNS Populations\nThe hypothesis suggests implications about the distribution of remaining systems after merger events, which can be assessed by computing the likelihood of observing the orbital period–eccentricity distribution of the Galactic DNS population under various population synthesis models [3](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/481/3/4009/5092622).

One promising approach involves using interferometric gravitational wave detectors, such as Advanced LIGO or Cosmic Explorer, to measure the axion-photon coupling constant.\n\n## Proposed Scheme\n\nThe proposed scheme involves using a linear optical cavity, applied to the Fabry-Pérot arm of gravitational wave detectors, to measure the phase difference between circular-polarized photons induced by axion dark matter. This approach has the potential to enhance the sensitivity to the axion-photon coupling constant.\n\n## Sensitivity\n\nThe potential sensitivity of the proposed scheme for measuring the axion-photon coupling constant using a Fabry-Pérot arm in gravitational wave detectors is $g_{a\\gamma} \\simeq 8 \\times 10^{-13} \\text{GeV}^{-1}$ ($4 \\times 10^{-14} \\text{GeV}^{-1}$) at the axion mass $m \\simeq 3 \\times 10^{-13} \\text{eV}$ ($2 \\times 10^{-15} \\text{eV}$) [1,2,3,4]. This sensitivity remains at around this level for three orders of magnitude in mass. Furthermore, its sensitivity has a sharp peak reaching $g_{a\\gamma} \\simeq 10^{-14} \\text{GeV}^{-1}$ ($8 \\times 10^{-17} \\text{GeV}^{-1}$) at $m = 1.563 \\times 10^{-10} \\text{eV}$ ($1.563 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{eV}$) [1,2,3,4].\n\n## Experimental Parameters\n\nThis sensitivity can be achieved with the experimental parameters of existing gravitational wave detector projects, such as DECIGO, CE, and aLIGO, without losing any sensitivity to gravitational waves [5]. The proposed scheme could enhance the $\\gamma \\rightarrow a \\rightarrow \\gamma$ rate by a factor $FF'/\\pi^2$, where $F$ and $F'$ are the finesses of the two cavities, potentially improving the $g_{a\\gamma\\gamma}$ sensitivity by $10^{2.5-3}$ [6].\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe proposed scheme for measuring the axion-photon coupling constant using a Fabry-Pérot arm in gravitational wave detectors has the potential to achieve high sensitivity to axion dark matter.

One promising approach involves using interferometric gravitational wave detectors, such as Advanced LIGO or Cosmic Explorer, to measure the axion-photon coupling constant.\n\nProposed Scheme\n\nThe proposed scheme involves using a linear optical cavity, applied to the Fabry-Pérot arm of gravitational wave detectors, to measure the phase difference between circular-polarized photons induced by axion dark matter. This approach has the potential to enhance the sensitivity to the axion-photon coupling constant.\n\nSensitivity\n\nThe potential sensitivity of the proposed scheme for measuring the axion-photon coupling constant using a Fabry-Pérot arm in gravitational wave detectors is \n𝑔\n𝑎\n𝛾\n≃\n8\n×\n10\n−\n13\nGeV\n−\n1\ng\naγ\n\t​\n\n≃8×10\n−13\nGeV\n−1\n (\n4\n×\n10\n−\n14\nGeV\n−\n1\n4×10\n−14\nGeV\n−1\n) at the axion mass \n𝑚\n≃\n3\n×\n10\n−\n13\neV\nm≃3×10\n−13\neV (\n2\n×\n10\n−\n15\neV\n2×10\n−15\neV) [1,2,3,4]. This sensitivity remains at around this level for three orders of magnitude in mass. Furthermore, its sensitivity has a sharp peak reaching \n𝑔\n𝑎\n𝛾\n≃\n10\n−\n14\nGeV\n−\n1\ng\naγ\n\t​\n\n≃10\n−14\nGeV\n−1\n (\n8\n×\n10\n−\n17\nGeV\n−\n1\n8×10\n−17\nGeV\n−1\n) at \n𝑚\n=\n1.563\n×\n10\n−\n10\neV\nm=1.563×10\n−10\neV (\n1.563\n×\n10\n−\n11\neV\n1.563×10\n−11\neV) [1,2,3,4].\n\nExperimental Parameters\n\nThis sensitivity can be achieved with the experimental parameters of existing gravitational wave detector projects, such as DECIGO, CE, and aLIGO, without losing any sensitivity to gravitational waves [5]. The proposed scheme could enhance the \n𝛾\n→\n𝑎\n→\n𝛾\nγ→a→γ rate by a factor \n𝐹\n𝐹\n′\n/\n𝜋\n2\nFF\n′\n/π\n2\n, where \n𝐹\nF and \n𝐹\n′\nF\n′\n are the finesses of the two cavities, potentially improving the \n𝑔\n𝑎\n𝛾\n𝛾\ng\naγγ\n\t​\n\n sensitivity by \n10\n2.5\n−\n3\n10\n2.5−3\n [6].\n\nImplications of Proposed Scheme's Sensitivity on Axion Dark Matter Detection\n\nThe proposed scheme's sensitivity has significant implications for the detection of axion dark matter in the context of existing gravitational wave detector projects. The sensitivity of the proposed scheme can be used to overcome current upper limits across a broad axion mass range and potentially establish better bounds compared to those proposed by axion experiments. This is particularly relevant for axion masses in the range of \n10\n−\n12\n10\n−12\n eV to \n10\n−\n15\n10\n−15\n eV.\n\nThe proposed scheme can also be used to search for axion dark matter using interferometric gravitational wave detectors. By measuring the phase difference of circular-polarized photons induced by axion dark matter, the scheme can achieve a sensitivity to the axion-photon coupling constant, \n𝑔\n𝑎\n𝛾\ng\naγ\n\t​\n\n, of around \n8\n×\n10\n−\n13\n8×10\n−13\n GeV\n−\n1\n−1\n to \n4\n×\n10\n−\n14\n4×10\n−14\n GeV\n−\n1\n−1\n at axion masses of \n3\n×\n10\n−\n13\n3×10\n−13\n eV to \n2\n×\n10\n−\n15\n2×10\n−15\n eV.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe proposed scheme for measuring the axion-photon coupling constant using a Fabry-Pérot arm in gravitational wave detectors has the potential to achieve high sensitivity to axion dark matter.

This duration cutoff is a key observational criterion that has been consistently used to categorize GRBs.\n\n2. **Spectral Properties**: \n   - Long GRBs typically exhibit softer spectra and are associated with the collapse of massive stars (supernovae), showing features such as the presence of a supernova signature in their afterglows.\n   - Short GRBs, on the other hand, have harder spectra and do not show the same association with supernovae. They are often characterized by a lack of extended emission and a different afterglow behavior.\n\n3. **Host Galaxy Environments**: \n   - Long GRBs are often found in star-forming regions of galaxies, indicating a connection to massive star formation. They are frequently associated with the deaths of massive stars (Wolf-Rayet stars).\n   - Short GRBs are typically found in older, more evolved galaxies, suggesting they are linked to different progenitor systems.\n\n4. **Afterglow Observations**: \n   - The afterglow of long GRBs can last for days to weeks and is often detected across a wide range of wavelengths. In contrast, short GRBs have afterglows that are generally fainter and decay more rapidly.\n\n5. **Progenitor Models**: \n   - Theoretical models and simulations support the idea that long GRBs arise from the core-collapse of massive stars, leading to the formation of black holes or neutron stars.\n   - Short GRBs are believed to originate from the merger of compact binary systems, such as neutron star-neutron star (NS-NS) or neutron star-black hole (NS-BH) mergers.\n\n### Progenitor Origins\n\n- **Long GRBs**: \n  - These are associated with the deaths of massive stars (typically greater than 30 solar masses) that undergo core collapse. The collapse leads to the formation of a black hole or a neutron star, and the accompanying supernova explosion can produce the energetic jets that result in the observed gamma-ray emission.\n\n- **Short GRBs**: \n  - These are thought to originate from the merger of compact objects, specifically binary neutron stars or neutron star-black hole systems. The merger process releases a significant amount of energy, resulting in a short burst of gamma rays, often accompanied by gravitational waves, as confirmed by the detection of gravitational waves from events like GW170817.\n\nIn summary, the evidence supporting the existence of two distinct classes of GRBs is robust, encompassing differences in duration, spectral characteristics, host environments, afterglow behavior, and progenitor origins.

The differing progenitor origins of short and long GRBs, including the collapse of massive stars and mergers of compact-object binaries, respectively, suggest that these two classes have distinct formation mechanisms. Short GRBs are thought to originate from mergers of compact-object binaries, such as neutron star-neutron star or neutron star-black hole binaries, while long GRBs are associated with the core collapse of massive stars, typically born at sub-solar metallicity, with hydrogen envelopes lost or burned prior to explosion as broad-lined type Ic supernovae. The host galaxies of long GRBs tend to be star-forming dwarfs with low metallicities and high specific star formation rates, while short GRBs occur in more typical galaxies with a range of metallicities and higher stellar masses. The durations of GRBs are anticorrelated with their spectral hardness ratios, such that short GRBs are predominantly harder, and longer ones tend to be softer. The two classes have different correlations between $E_{p, rest}$ and $E_{iso}$, with the current sample suggesting $E_{p, rest} =2455 \\times (E_{iso}/10^{52})^{0.59}$ for short GRBs, significantly different from that for long GRBs. Recent studies have provided further evidence supporting the existence of two distinct classes of GRBs, including a comprehensive multi-wavelength comparative study performed by Y Li in 2016 [IOP Science](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/0067-0049/227/1/7) and a study published in [Oxford Academic](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/527/3/7111/7450464) that reported new evidence supporting the existence of different origins for two classes of GRBs, specifically EE-I GRBs and EE-II GRBs. Additionally, research reported in [Science Direct](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0273-1177(10)00523-5) found evidence suggesting a distinction between short and long GRBs based on their spectral analysis. A study presented by A Shahmoradi in 2015 [Oxford Academic](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/451/1/126/1349308) examined the luminosity function, energetics, prompt gamma-ray correlations, and classification methodology of GRBs, providing insights into their properties and potential progenitor origins. The classification of GRBs into short and long classes is supported by differences in their spectral hardness and event rates. Short GRBs have, on average, a higher hardness ratio (HR) than long GRBs, indicating harder spectra [1]. Spectral analysis shows that short GRBs are harder than long events, not due to a higher peak energy, but rather a harder low-energy spectral component [2]. The low-energy spectral index of short bursts is harder than that of long GRBs, with $\\alpha$ values indicating a harder spectrum for short GRBs [3]. In conclusion, the evidence supporting the existence of two distinct classes of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) based on their duration is extensive.\nREFERENCES\n\n<TASK_OUTPUT>\n\nScience Direct\nIOP Science\nOxford Academic\nADS Harvard\nIOP Science\nOxford Academic\nWikipedia\nWikipedia\nAPS\narXiv\nFiveable\nAanda\nResearchgate\nMdpi\nSpringer\nIopscience\nAanda\nNasa\nPmc </TASK_OUTPUT>", "marvel_deepsearch_score": 9, "evaluation_model_type": "openai", "evaluation_model_name": "gpt-4o-mini", "qa_model_type": "openai", "qa_model_name": "gpt-4o-mini", "gpt4o_mini_answer_relevancy": 0.98, "gpt4o_mini_answer_correctness": 0.98, "gpt4o_mini_faithfulness": 0.98, "marvel_standard_answer_relevancy": 0.9, "marvel_standard_answer_correctness": 0.9, "marvel_standard_faithfulness": 0.92, "marvel_deepsearch_answer_relevancy": 0.965, "marvel_deepsearch_answer_correctness": 0.98, "marvel_deepsearch_faithfulness": 0.95}

The expected SNR values for these sources can be summarized as follows:\n\n- **Binary Neutron Stars (BNS)**: For BNS mergers, LIGO can achieve SNR values typically in the range of 10 to 100, depending on the distance to the source and the specific parameters of the binary system. For example, a BNS merger at a distance of about 100 Mpc could yield an SNR of around 30 to 50.\n\n- **Supermassive Black Hole Binaries (SBBH)**: LIGO is less sensitive to SBBH due to their lower frequency signals (typically in the mHz range), which are not within LIGO's optimal detection band. However, if an SBBH were to merge within the LIGO frequency band, the SNR could be substantial, potentially exceeding 100, depending on the mass and distance of the system.\n\n### LISA\nLISA (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna) is designed to detect gravitational waves from lower frequency sources, including supermassive black hole binaries.\n\n- **Supermassive Black Hole Binaries (SBBH)**: For SBBH, LISA is expected to achieve very high SNR values, often in the range of 10 to 1000 or more, depending on the mass of the black holes and their distance. For example, a binary with masses around \\(10^6\\) to \\(10^9\\) solar masses at a distance of a few Gpc could yield SNR values well above 100.\n\n- **Binary Neutron Stars (BNS)**: LISA is not primarily designed for BNS detection, as these systems typically emit gravitational waves at frequencies that are better suited for LIGO. However, if LISA were to detect a BNS, the SNR would likely be lower than for LIGO, potentially in the range of 1 to 10, depending on the specific parameters.\n\n### Summary\n- **LIGO**: \n  - BNS: SNR ~ 10 to 100 (depending on distance)\n  - SBBH: SNR can be high if within the frequency range, but generally not the primary target.\n\n- **LISA**: \n  - SBBH: SNR ~ 10 to 1000 (depending on mass and distance)\n  - BNS: SNR ~ 1 to 10 (not the primary target)\n\nThese values are indicative and can vary based on the specific observational conditions, the sensitivity of the instruments, and the astrophysical parameters of the sources.", "gpt4o_mini_score": 8, "marvel_standard_answer": "<QUERY> What are the expected signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values predicted for gravitational wave sources such as supermassive black hole binaries (SBBH) and binary neutron stars (BNS) for LISA and LIGO over a specified observation time period?.

The expected signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) for these sources are crucial in determining their detectability. In this article, we discuss the expected SNR values for gravitational wave sources, including supermassive black hole binaries (SBBH) and binary neutron stars (BNS), for LISA and LIGO over a specified observation time period.\n\n## SNR Values for LIGO/VIRGO and LISA\n--------------------------------------\n\nLIGO/VIRGO and LISA are expected to detect various types of gravitational wave sources, including coalescing binary black holes (BBHs) and binary neutron stars (BNS). For LIGO/VIRGO, the expected SNRs for BBHs are estimated to be moderate (a few tens) for masses in the range of a few to about $2000$ solar masses [1]. In contrast, LISA is expected to achieve high SNRs (of order $10^4$) for masses in the range of about $10^5$ to $10^8$ solar masses.\n\n## SNR Values for Supermassive Black Hole Binaries and Binary Neutron Stars\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFor supermassive black hole binaries (SBBH) and binary neutron stars (BNS), the expected SNR values have been studied in the context of LISA data analysis [2]. LISA will simultaneously observe all sources all the time, with scheduled interruptions only for short periods of time, as needed for communications and spacecraft maintenance. The LISA data streams are expected to contain tens of thousands of signals, with SNR values ranging from the detection threshold (SNR ∼5) to more than 10,000.\n\n## Measurement Band and Sources\n------------------------------\n\nThe arm length of LISA has been chosen to provide a measurement band from $3 \\times10^{-5}$ Hz to $0.1$ Hz, which includes an abundance of sources such as coalescing massive black holes, among the strongest sources LISA will detect with an SNR of many thousand, large numbers (>10,000) of compact binary systems in our galaxy, as well as hundreds of compact objects falling into massive black holes at the center of galaxies, all with SNR above the detection threshold (SNR >5) [2].\n\n## Analysis of SNR Values\n-------------------------\n\nThe expected SNR values for gravitational wave sources, including SBBH and BNS, have also been examined using phenomenological waveforms for inspiral, merger, and ringdown [3]. This analysis considers a wide range of massive black hole binaries and evaluates the SNR using $SNR = \\frac{h_{rss}}{\\sigma_{h}}$, where $h_{rss}$ is the root-sum-square strain and $\\sigma_{h}$ is the noise strain.\n\n## Conclusion\n----------\n\nIn conclusion, the expected SNR values for gravitational wave sources, such as supermassive black hole binaries (SBBH) and binary neutron stars (BNS), for LISA and LIGO over a specified observation time period have been discussed. The SNR values range from the detection threshold to more than 10,000, depending on the source and the observatory.\n\n## References\n---------------\n\n* [1] [https://inspirehep.net/literature/439636](https://inspirehep.net/literature/439636)\n* [2] [https://lisa.nasa.gov/archive2011/Documentation/LISA-MSO-TN-1001_v2d4.pdf](https://lisa.nasa.gov/archive2011/Documentation/LISA-MSO-TN-1001_v2d4.pdf)\n* [3] [https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/483/3/3108/5234247](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/483/3/3108/5234247)\n\n</ARTICLE>", "marvel_standard_score": 7, "marvel_deepsearch_answer": "Expected Signal-to-Noise Ratios for Gravitational Wave Sources\n\n====================================================================\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe detection of gravitational waves from various astrophysical sources is a primary goal of current and future gravitational wave observatories, such as LIGO/VIRGO and LISA.

However, it is implied that for LISA, an SNR threshold of 8 over a 4-year observation period yields an event rate of less than 10, and about half of the sBBH events have an SNR below 5. LISA's sensitivity corresponds to an SNR of 5 over a one-year integration time.\n\nThe closest relevant information is:\n\nSNR threshold of 8 for LISA over 4 years yields less than 10 events.\nApproximately half of sBBH events have SNR below 5 in LISA.\nLISA sensitivity for SNR of 5 over one-year integration.\nAdditional Details on SNR Predictions for SBBH and BNS\n\nRecent studies have provided more detailed predictions for SNR values of SBBH and BNS sources. For instance, a novel coherent multiband analysis framework for characterizing stellar- and intermediate-mass binary black holes using LISA and next-generation ground-based detectors has been presented [4]. This framework highlights the importance of combining LISA and ground-based observations to improve the detection and characterization of these sources.\n\nSNR Value Predictions\n\nThe specific SNR value predictions for SBBH and BNS sources detectable by LISA versus LIGO over a 1-year observation period can be estimated using the Post-Newtonian (PN) approximation. Specifically, the 2.5PN approximation can be accurate enough for the early inspiral stage of sBBHs.\n\nConclusion on SNR Predictions\n\nIn conclusion, while specific SNR value predictions for SBBH and BNS sources detectable by LISA versus LIGO over a 1-year observation period are not directly provided, the studies suggest that LISA will predict, with years of forewarning, the time and frequency with which binaries will be observed by LIGO.\n\nUpdated SNR Predictions\n\nNew research has provided additional insights into SNR predictions for SBBH and BNS sources. For example, [5] presents an analysis of the effect of the LISA observation duration on the pure model selection results. This study compares the SNR values for different observation durations and provides valuable information for future LISA missions.\n\nReferences\n[1] https://inspirehep.net/literature/439636\n[2] https://lisa.nasa.gov/archive2011/Documentation/LISA-MSO-TN-1001_v2d4.pdf\n[3] https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/483/3/3108/5234247\n[4] https://arxiv.org/html/2506.01898v1\n[5] https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Effect-of-the-LISA-observation-duration-on-the-pure-model-selection-results-We-compare_fig2_47843269\n[6] https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.104.043019\n[7] https://inspirehep.net/literature/1898331\n[8] https://arxiv.org/html/2304.10340v2\n[9] https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.102.124037\n[10] https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.99.124043\n[11] http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Stochastic_gravitational_wave_backgrounds", "marvel_deepsearch_score": 7, "evaluation_model_type": "openai", "evaluation_model_name": "gpt-4o-mini", "qa_model_type": "openai", "qa_model_name": "gpt-4o-mini", "gpt4o_mini_answer_relevancy": 0.92, "gpt4o_mini_answer_correctness": 0.8, "gpt4o_mini_faithfulness": 0.7, "marvel_standard_answer_relevancy": 0.98, "marvel_standard_answer_correctness": 0.8, "marvel_standard_faithfulness": 0.95, "marvel_deepsearch_answer_relevancy": 0.05, "marvel_deepsearch_answer_correctness": 0.2, "marvel_deepsearch_faithfulness": 0.05}

In contrast, the detection rate from population I/II stars is significantly higher, with a difference in merger rate density of about 4 orders of magnitude. This difference is attributed to the higher mass of merging BH binaries formed from population III stars (total mass of 63.4 solar masses) compared to those from population I/II stars (total mass of 29.7 solar masses), leading to stronger gravitational waves and a larger detector horizon.", "gpt4o_mini_answer": "The detection rate of black hole (BH) mergers from Population III stars compared to those from Population I/II stars is a topic of ongoing research in astrophysics. Population III stars are the first generation of stars formed in the universe, composed almost entirely of hydrogen and helium, and they are believed to have formed in the early universe, roughly between redshifts of 20 to 10. In contrast, Population I and II stars are formed later and have heavier elements due to the processes of stellar nucleosynthesis and supernovae.\n\n### Estimated Detection Rates\n\n1. **Population III Stars**: \n   - Population III stars are thought to be massive (often over 100 solar masses) and short-lived, leading to the formation of black holes that could merge. However, the actual detection rate of mergers from these stars is uncertain due to their rarity and the early epoch of their formation.\n   - The merger rates of black holes formed from Population III stars are estimated to be lower than those from Population I/II stars because the number of Population III stars is limited to the early universe, and they are not as abundant as later generations.\n\n2. **Population I/II Stars**: \n   - Population I and II stars are more abundant and have a wider range of masses, leading to a higher overall rate of black hole formation and mergers. The merger rates from these populations are better constrained by current observations, particularly from gravitational wave detections by LIGO and Virgo.\n   - The estimated merger rates for black holes from Population I/II stars are significantly higher, with current estimates suggesting rates on the order of tens to hundreds of mergers per year detectable by current gravitational wave observatories.\n\n### Contributing Factors to Differences\n\n1. **Abundance and Formation**: \n   - Population III stars are rare and formed in a different environment compared to Population I/II stars. The conditions in the early universe favored the formation of massive stars, but the overall number of these stars is much lower than the stars formed in later epochs.\n\n2. **Mass Distribution**: \n   - Population III stars are expected to have a top-heavy mass distribution, leading to the formation of very massive black holes. In contrast, Population I/II stars have a more varied mass distribution, resulting in a wider range of black hole masses and potentially more merger events.\n\n3. **Metallicity**: \n   - Population III stars have very low metallicity, which affects their evolution and the mechanisms of mass loss during their lifetimes. This can influence the final mass of the black holes they produce and their subsequent merger rates.\n\n4. **Cosmological Evolution**: \n   - The universe's expansion and the formation of structures over time affect the environments in which stars form and evolve.

In contrast, the event rate of such BBH mergers is $0.13$-$0.66$ yr$^{-1}$Gpc$^{-3}$ [2]. The detection rate of Pop III BBH mergers involving at least one intermediate-mass BH above $100 M_{\\odot}$ by the Einstein Telescope is $\\sim0.5 -200 yr^{-1}$ [3].\n\n## Factors Contributing to Detection Rates\n--------------------------------------\n\nThe detection rates of BH mergers from population III stars are affected by several factors, including:\n\n*   **Binary-star physics**: The merger rate density of isolated Pop. III binary black holes (BBHs) is $\\mathcal{R} \\leq10$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$, while the merger rate density of BBHs formed via dynamical capture is $\\mathcal{R} \\sim200$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ at a redshift $z \\sim15$ [4].\n*   **Cosmic star formation rate**: The cosmic star formation rate and metallicity play a crucial role in determining the detection rates of BH mergers from population III stars [5].\n*   **Initial mass function (IMF)**: The IMF, particularly the slope and mass range, affects the detection rates of BH mergers from population III stars [1].\n*   **Nuclear star clusters (NSCs)**: The presence of NSCs can influence the detection rates of BH mergers from population III stars, with the NSC-DH channel contributing $\\sim8-95\\%$ of Pop III BBH mergers across cosmic history [6].\n\n## Detection Fractions and Rates\n------------------------------\n\nThe detection fraction of black hole mergers for the assumed population is similar to the one obtained for the reference Pop III model [7]. Next-generation detectors, such as the Einstein Telescope (ET) and Cosmic Explorer (CE), are expected to be sensitive to mergers at high redshift, with BBHs having a total mass of a hundred solar masses that merge at being redshifted to merger frequencies in the sub-Hz regime, below [7].\n\n## Conclusion\n----------\n\nThe estimated detection rates of black hole mergers from population III stars compared to those from population I/II stars vary widely depending on the factors considered. Further studies are needed to refine these estimates and better understand the contributions of population III stars to the observed BH merger rates.\n\n## References\n--------------\n\n[1] [arXiv.org/abs/2406.17397](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17397)\n\n[2] [arXiv.org/html/2504.20392v1](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.20392v1)\n\n[3] [academic.oup.com/mnras/article/534/3/1634/7755420](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/534/3/1634/7755420)\n\n[4] [aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2024/10/aa50667-24/aa50667-24.html](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2024/10/aa50667-24/aa50667-24.html)\n\n[5] [researchgate.net/publication/351803342_On_the_population_III_binary_black_hole_mergers_beyond_the_pair-instability_mass_gap](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/351803342_On_the_population_III_binary_black_hole_mergers_beyond_the_pair-instability_mass_gap)\n\n[6] [iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/abe40d](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/abe40d)\n\n[7] [link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.110.023036](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.110.023036)", "marvel_standard_score": 8, "marvel_deepsearch_answer": "The estimated detection rate of black hole (BH) mergers from population III stars compared to those from population I/II stars varies widely.

Population III stars, being metal-free, produce more massive black holes (\n∼\n30\n−\n40\n𝑀\n⊙\n∼30−40M\n⊙\n\t​\n\n) and have detectable mergers at higher redshifts (\n𝑧\n>\n8\nz>8). In contrast, Population I/II stars produce lower-mass black holes (\n∼\n8\n–\n10\n𝑀\n⊙\n∼8–10M\n⊙\n\t​\n\n). The detection rates are also affected by the star formation rate density evolution and the distribution of metallicity at fixed formation redshift.\n\nThe Einstein Telescope is expected to detect \n10\n–\n10\n4\n10–10\n4\n Population III binary black hole (BBH) mergers per year, depending on the star formation history and binary star properties. For the fiducial model, approximately \n530\n530 detections per year are expected, with \n68\n%\n68% from BBH mergers occurring at redshift \n𝑧\n>\n8\nz>8.\n\nDetailed Detection Rates\nThe estimated detection rate of coalescing Pop III binary black hole (BBH) mergers is \n140\n(\n68\n)\n140(68) events yr\n−\n1\n−1\n for the flat (Salpeter) initial mass function (IMF) [2].\nThe event rate of such BBH mergers is \n0.13\n0.13-\n0.66\n0.66 yr\n−\n1\n−1\nGpc\n−\n3\n−3\n [2].\nThe detection rate of Pop III BBH mergers involving at least one intermediate-mass BH above \n100\n𝑀\n⊙\n100M\n⊙\n\t​\n\n by the Einstein Telescope is \n∼\n0.5\n−\n200\n𝑦\n𝑟\n−\n1\n∼0.5−200yr\n−1\n [3].\nImplications of Detection Rate Differences\n\nThe detection rate differences between black hole mergers from Population III stars and those from Population I/ii stars have significant implications for our understanding of early universe stellar evolution and structure formation. Population III stars dominate only during the very first stages of structure formation, with an average contribution to the total star formation rate that is significant at \n𝑧\n≳\n10\nz≳10 but diminishes rapidly at lower redshifts.\n\nRole of Population III Stars\n\nPopulation III stars, also known as first stars or metal-free stars, are believed to have played a crucial role in early universe evolution, including reionization and metal enrichment history. These stars likely produced the first stellar-born binary black hole (BBH) mergers in the Universe.\n\nGravitational Wave Signal and Detection Rates\n\nThe gravitational wave (GW) signal from binary black hole (BBH) mergers is a promising probe of Population III (Pop III) stars. Next-generation gravitational-wave observatories will reach farther into the Universe than currently possible, revealing black-hole mergers from early stellar binary systems such as Population III stars, whose properties are currently poorly constrained.\n\nKey Differences in Mass Distribution and Merger Rates\n\nThe mass distribution and merger rates of black holes formed from Population III stars versus those from Population I/II stars exhibit distinct differences.\n\nMass Distribution\nPrimary Black Hole Mass: The primary black holes born from Population III stars tend to be rather massive (\n30\n–\n40\n𝑀\n⊙\n30–40M\n⊙\n\t​\n\n) compared to those born from metal-rich stars (\n8\n–\n10\n𝑀\n⊙\n8–10M\n⊙\n\t​\n\n) [1, 2, 3].\nSecondary Black Hole Mass: The most common secondary BH mass for Pop. III stars is \n∼\n20\n𝑀\n⊙\n∼20M\n⊙\n\t​\n\n, while for Pop. II stars it is either \n∼\n8\n–\n10\n𝑀\n⊙\n∼8–10M\n⊙\n\t​\n\n or \n∼\n35\n–\n38\n𝑀\n⊙\n∼35–38M\n⊙\n\t​\n\n, depending on the model [4].\nTotal Source Mass: The average total source mass for binary black hole (BBH) mergers is generally higher for population III binaries due to their extremely low metallicity, resulting in a more top-heavy initial mass function and negligible mass loss in stellar winds [5].\nMerger Rates\nMerger Rate Density: The merger rate densities of binary BHs for Pop III stars are minor contributors compared to Pop I/II stars at low redshifts. However, at a redshift of \n𝑧\n>\n10\nz>10, Pop III binary BHs become dominant [6].\nRedshift Evolution: The redshift evolution of the binary BH merger rate density in the fiducial set is consistent with the GWTC-3 result. The fiducial set can reproduce the primary BH mass and mass ratio distributions inferred by the GWTC-3 result [6].\nPair-Instability Mass Gap\nPop III Stars: Pop III stars can fill the pair-instability mass gap, which ranges from \n∼\n60\n  \n𝑀\n⊙\n∼60M\n⊙\n\t​\n\n to \n∼\n130\n  \n𝑀\n⊙\n∼130M\n⊙\n\t​\n\n for Pop I/II stars [6].\nMergers Inside the Gap: Mergers with primary BH mass inside the gap are up to \n1.9\n1.9 per cent (LOG3) and up to \n2.4\n2.4 per cent (TOP5) for Pop. III and Pop. II stars, respectively [4].\nDetection and Formation\nDetection Rates: The Einstein Telescope is estimated to detect \n10\n−\n10\n4\n10−10\n4\n Pop. III BBH mergers per year, depending on the star formation history and binary star properties [7, 8].\nFormation Channels: The main formation channel of BBH mergers from Population III and II stars involves only stable mass transfer episodes in the fiducial model [9].\n\nThe specific binary-star physics and cosmological factors driving the differences in detection rates of black hole mergers between Population III stars and Population I/II stars include:\n\nBinary star properties: Initial orbital properties of binary stars, such as orbital periods, which affect the merger rate density.\nStar formation history: The rate and timing of star formation, which influences the detection rates of black hole mergers.\nStellar evolution models: The mass loss and evolutionary tracks of Population III stars versus Population I/II stars.\nCosmological factors: The expansion history of the universe and the distribution of matter and energy.\n\nThese factors influence the merger rate density, mass distributions, and detection rates of black hole mergers. According to the studies referenced in the provided documents, Population III stars are expected to produce more massive black holes, which are easier to detect, and their binary systems are likely to have different properties than those of Population I/II stars.\n\nEstimated Detection Rates\n\nThe estimated detection rate of coalescing Pop III binary black hole (BBH) mergers is \n140\n(\n68\n)\n140(68) events yr\n−\n1\n−1\n for the flat (Salpeter) initial mass function (IMF) [2]. In contrast, the event rate of such BBH mergers is \n0.13\n0.13-\n0.66\n0.66 yr\n−\n1\n−1\nGpc\n−\n3\n−3\n [2]. The detection rate of Pop III BBH mergers involving at least one intermediate-mass BH above \n100\n𝑀\n⊙\n100M\n⊙\n\t​\n\n by the Einstein Telescope is \n∼\n0.5\n−\n200\n𝑦\n𝑟\n−\n1\n∼0.5−200yr\n−1\n [3].\n\nFactors Contributing to Detection Rates\n\nThe detection rates of BH mergers from population III stars are affected by several factors, including:\n\nBinary-star physics: The merger rate density of isolated Pop. III binary black holes (BBHs) is \n𝑅\n≤\n10\nR≤10 Gpc\n−\n3\n−3\n yr\n−\n1\n−1\n, while the merger rate density of BBHs formed via dynamical capture is \n𝑅\n∼\n200\nR∼200 Gpc\n−\n3\n−3\n yr\n−\n1\n−1\n at a redshift \n𝑧\n∼\n15\nz∼15 [4].\nCosmic star formation rate: The cosmic star formation rate and metallicity play a crucial role in determining the detection rates of BH mergers from population III stars [5].\nInitial mass function (IMF): The IMF, particularly the slope and mass range, affects the detection rates of BH mergers from population III stars [1].\nNuclear star clusters (NSCs): The presence of NSCs can influence the detection rates of BH mergers from population III stars, with the NSC-DH channel contributing \n∼\n8\n−\n95\n%\n∼8−95% of Pop III BBH mergers across cosmic history [6].\nDetection Fractions and Rates\n\nThe detection fraction of black hole mergers for the assumed population is similar to the one obtained for the reference Pop III model [7]. Next-generation detectors, such as the Einstein Telescope (ET) and Cosmic Explorer (CE), are expected to be sensitive to mergers at high redshift, with BBHs having a total mass of a hundred solar masses that merge at being redshifted to merger frequencies in the sub-Hz regime, below [7].\n\nConclusion\n\nThe estimated detection rates of black hole mergers from population III stars compared to those from population I/ii stars vary widely depending on the factors considered.

Here are some astrophysical sources that can mimic the lensing signature of PBHs:\n\n1. **Stellar Mass Black Holes**: These are formed from the collapse of massive stars and can lens light from background sources in a similar way to PBHs.\n\n2. **Neutron Stars**: Like black holes, neutron stars can also act as gravitational lenses, especially if they are in binary systems or if they are part of a dense stellar environment.\n\n3. **Galactic and Extragalactic Structures**: Massive galaxies, galaxy clusters, and other large-scale structures can lens light from background objects, creating multiple images or distorted arcs that can mimic the effects of PBHs.\n\n4. **Dark Matter Halos**: If dark matter is clumped in certain regions, it can create lensing effects similar to those of PBHs, especially if the dark matter consists of compact objects.\n\n5. **Other Compact Objects**: Objects such as white dwarfs or even dense stellar remnants can also produce lensing effects.\n\nTo reduce the background from these astrophysical sources and better isolate the lensing signature due to PBHs, several strategies can be employed:\n\n1. **Statistical Analysis**: By analyzing a large number of lensing events, one can statistically distinguish between the lensing signatures of PBHs and those from other astrophysical sources based on their expected distributions and characteristics.\n\n2. **Multi-Wavelength Observations**: Observing the same lensing events across different wavelengths (e.g., optical, infrared, radio) can help identify the nature of the lensing object. For instance, the presence of X-ray emissions could indicate a stellar mass black hole rather than a PBH.\n\n3. **Time-Delay Measurements**: For lensed systems with multiple images, measuring the time delays between the images can provide information about the mass and nature of the lensing object, helping to differentiate between PBHs and other compact objects.\n\n4. **Microlensing Surveys**: Conducting dedicated microlensing surveys in regions with low stellar density can help reduce the background from other lensing sources, allowing for a clearer view of potential PBH signatures.\n\n5. **Modeling and Simulations**: Developing detailed models of the expected lensing signatures from various astrophysical sources can help in identifying and subtracting these backgrounds from observational data.\n\n6. **Targeting Specific Regions**: Focusing on regions of the sky that are less populated with stars and other compact objects can help reduce the background noise from other lensing sources.\n\nBy employing these methods, researchers can enhance their ability to detect and study the lensing signatures specifically attributable to primordial black holes.", "gpt4o_mini_score": 8, "marvel_standard_answer": "<QUERY> What are the astrophysical sources that can mimic the lensing signature due to primordial black holes (PBHs) and how can their background be reduced? </QUERY>\n\n<ANSWER>\nAstrophysical sources that can mimic the lensing signature due to primordial black holes (PBHs) include:\n\n1. **Ultra-faint-dwarf galaxies**: These galaxies can produce similar lensing effects, reducing the constraining power on the mass region of PBHs between $1$ and $100M_{\\odot}$ and the asteroid-mass region.\n2. **X-ray sources towards the galactic center**: These sources can also mimic PBH lensing signatures.\n3. **Neutron stars**: Neutron stars can produce similar microlensing effects.\n4. **White dwarves**: White dwarves can also mimic PBH lensing signatures.\n5. **Dwarf galaxies**: The core profile of dwarf galaxies can produce similar lensing effects.\n6. **Supermassive black holes at high redshifts**: These black holes can also mimic PBH lensing signatures.\n7. **Quasars**: Quasars can produce variable lensing effects that might be mistaken for PBHs.\n8. **Galaxy clusters**: Galaxy clusters, such as SDSS J1004+4112, can also produce similar lensing effects.\n\nTo reduce the background of these astrophysical sources:\n\n1. **Gravitational wave (GW) detectors**: The development of ultra-high frequency GW detectors can help complement the search for GW signatures of asteroid-mass PBHs and reduce the background.\n2. **Microlensing surveys**: Microlensing surveys, such as those using the Gaia space telescope, can help detect PBHs and distinguish them from other astrophysical sources.\n3. **Multi-messenger astronomy**: Combining observations from different messengers, such as GWs, gamma-rays, and optical signals, can help identify PBHs and reduce the background.\n4. **Improved simulations**: Improved simulations of microlensing events and GW signals can help better understand the properties of PBHs and distinguish them from other sources.\n\n</ANSWER>\n\n## Astrophysical Sources Mimicking Primordial Black Holes and Background Reduction\n\nThe search for primordial black holes (PBHs) as a component of dark matter is an active area of research. However, various astrophysical sources can mimic the lensing signature due to PBHs, making their detection challenging. These sources include ultra-faint-dwarf galaxies, X-ray sources towards the galactic center, high-cadence microlensing, neutron stars, and white dwarves. These sources have revived or reduced the constraining power on the mass region of PBHs, particularly between $1$ and $100M_{\\odot}$ and the asteroid-mass region.\n\n### Distinguishing PBHs from Astrophysical Objects\n\nDistinguishing PBHs from other astrophysical objects is a challenging task due to several factors, including the dark nature of PBHs, which do not emit any radiation, making them difficult to detect directly. The abundance of PBHs is still uncertain, making it difficult to predict their detection rate. Gravitational lensing effects, including microlensing events, astrometric microlensing, and femtolensing, are some of the methods to detect PBHs.\n\n### Microlensing and Astrometric Microlensing\n\nThe Gaia space telescope allows for unprecedented accuracy for astrometric measurements of stars in the Galaxy, and its sensitivity to detect primordial black hole (PBH) dark matter through the distortions that PBHs would create in the apparent trajectories of background stars, an effect known as astrometric microlensing (AML), is explored. A novel calculation of the lensing probability is presented, combining this with the existing publicly released Gaia eDR3.

However, various astrophysical sources can mimic the lensing signature due to PBHs, making their detection challenging. These sources include ultra-faint-dwarf galaxies, X-ray sources towards the galactic center, high-cadence microlensing, neutron stars, white dwarves, dwarf galaxies, supermassive black holes at high redshifts, quasars, and galaxy clusters. These sources have revived or reduced the constraining power on the mass region of PBHs, particularly between \n1\n1 and \n100\n𝑀\n⊙\n100M\n⊙\n\t​\n\n and the asteroid-mass region.\n\nDistinguishing PBHs from Astrophysical Objects\n\nDistinguishing PBHs from other astrophysical objects is a challenging task due to several factors, including the dark nature of PBHs, which do not emit any radiation, making them difficult to detect directly. The abundance of PBHs is still uncertain, making it difficult to predict their detection rate. Gravitational lensing effects, including microlensing events, astrometric microlensing, and femtolensing, are some of the methods to detect PBHs.\n\nMicrolensing and Astrometric Microlensing\n\nThe Gaia space telescope allows for unprecedented accuracy for astrometric measurements of stars in the Galaxy, and its sensitivity to detect primordial black hole (PBH) dark matter through the distortions that PBHs would create in the apparent trajectories of background stars, an effect known as astrometric microlensing (AML), is explored. A novel calculation of the lensing probability is presented, combining this with the existing publicly released Gaia eDR3. The expected rate of AML events that Gaia will see is predicted using a stellar catalog.\n\nReducing Backgrounds\n\nThe astrophysical background rate of astrometric microlensing (AML) like events due to other sources is assumed to be negligible; however, the expected distribution of a few event observables can be computed to reduce backgrounds. The merging rate of PBH binaries, formed by tidal capture in clusters, can be at the same level as the rates inferred from GW observations.

A Bayesian framework is employed to search for a GWB originating from PBHs and other compact binary sources using data from the Advanced LIGO detectors and Virgo observatory.\n\nImplications of Gravitational Wave Background from Primordial Black Hole Binaries\n\nThe implications of the gravitational wave background from primordial black hole binaries on the detection of primordial black holes are significant, as it provides a means to constrain models of primordial black hole formation. The gravitational wave background can be used to inform on the formation of primordial black holes and enhance detectability prospects.\n\nThe gravitational wave background from primordial black hole binaries can be used to:\n\nConstrain models of primordial black hole formation by comparing theoretical predictions with observational limits.\nEnhance detectability prospects of primordial black holes.\nInform on the formation of primordial black holes.\n\nAccording to Document1 (arXiv:2405.13871), the study models the internal structure of globular clusters and derives the expected merger rate, showing that the contribution of primordial black holes in globular clusters to the GW background can be comparable to other well-known channels.\n\nAdditional Astrophysical Sources\n\nAdditional astrophysical sources that can mimic the lensing signature due to PBHs include:\n\nUltra-faint-dwarf galaxies: These galaxies can produce similar lensing effects, reducing the constraining power on the mass region of PBHs between \n1\n1 and \n100\n𝑀\n⊙\n100M\n⊙\n\t​\n\n and the asteroid-mass region.\nX-ray sources towards the galactic center: These sources can also mimic PBH lensing signatures.\nNeutron stars: Neutron stars can produce similar microlensing effects.\nWhite dwarves: White dwarves can also mimic PBH lensing signatures.\nDwarf galaxies: The core profile of dwarf galaxies can produce similar lensing effects.\nSupermassive black holes at high redshifts: These black holes can also mimic PBH lensing signatures.\nQuasars: Quasars can produce variable lensing effects that might be mistaken for PBHs.\nGalaxy clusters: Galaxy clusters, such as SDSS J1004+4112, can also produce similar lensing effects.\n\nTo reduce the background of these astrophysical sources:\n\nGravitational wave (GW) detectors: The development of ultra-high frequency GW detectors can help complement the search for GW signatures of asteroid-mass PBHs and reduce the background.\nMicrolensing surveys: Microlensing surveys, such as those using the Gaia space telescope, can help detect PBHs and distinguish them from other astrophysical sources.\nMulti-messenger astronomy: Combining observations from different messengers, such as GWs, gamma-rays, and optical signals, can help identify PBHs and reduce the background.\nImproved simulations: Improved simulations of microlensing events and GW signals can help better understand the properties of PBHs and distinguish them from other sources.\nThe Impact of Galaxy Cluster Distributions on Primordial Black Hole Lensing Signatures\n\nThe detection of primordial black hole (PBH) lensing signatures is crucial for understanding the existence of these mysterious objects. However, galaxy cluster distributions can significantly impact the accuracy of PBH detection. Clustering of black holes can act like giant pseudo-particles, affecting the emission from regions such as the Broad Line Region (BLR).\n\nTo mitigate these effects and improve the accuracy of primordial black hole detection, strategies may involve:\n\nConsidering the impact of cluster distributions on microlensing flux magnification.\nUsing alternative methods to define the zero microlensing baseline, such as intrinsic magnification ratios of quasar images predicted by macro lens models.\nAnalyzing large amplitude microlensing events to understand the effects of galaxy cluster distributions.\nEmploying approaches like the excursion-set method to study the initial spatial clustering of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs).\nLimitations of Current Microlensing Surveys\n\nThe limitations of current microlensing surveys, such as those using the Gaia space telescope, in detecting primordial black holes include:\n\nInsufficient precision of parallaxes due to crowding and a low number of epochs, typically less than \n30\n30 in Gaia DR3.\nA low density of stars acting as background sources in certain regions, leading to a low microlensing rate, with a survey depth of \n𝑉\n∼\n19\nV∼19 mag resulting in a microlensing event rate of about \n0.001\n0.001 events per year per degree\n2\n2\n.\nEvents with Galactic coordinates not following the Galactic plane are located in regions where the density of stars is very low, and therefore the microlensing rate is also very low.\nImproving Detection\n\nTo improve the detection of primordial black holes and distinguish their lensing signatures from those produced by other astrophysical sources:\n\nBetter precision of parallaxes and more epochs are needed.\nIncreasing the survey depth and the density of background stars could enhance the microlensing rate.\nUtilizing X-ray microlensing could help uncover pointlike lenses such as PBHs.\nImplementing advanced lens classification methods that incorporate posterior constraints on lightcurve parameters and other information can improve detection and classification.\n\nThe characteristic differences in astrometric microlensing effects caused by supermassive black holes at high redshifts versus primordial black holes include:\n\nDifferences in formation era\nDistinct microlensing effects\nObservable vibrations on a star's surface if a primordial black hole passes through it\n\nThese differences can be utilized to enhance the detection of primordial black holes by:\n\nInvestigating lensing configurations produced by a range of SMBH masses\nMonitoring quasars in the microwave wavelength and detecting the wave optics feature of gravitational microlensing by primordial black holes\nExploiting the distinct characteristics of microlensing effects caused by primordial black holes\n\nThe Roman Space Telescope's submilliarcsecond astrometric capabilities and its planned Galactic Bulge Time Domain Survey (GBTDS) will enable the detection of astrometric microlensing signatures. Astrometric microlensing signals are sensitive to different lens masses-distance configurations and contain different information, making it a complementary lensing probe.\n\nSources:\n\nhttps://cds.cern.ch/record/2882320/files/2310.19857.pdf\nhttps://www.numberanalytics.com/blog/astrophysics-of-primordial-black-holes\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2208.14460\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2212686422000887\nhttps://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2020/01/aa36462-19/aa36462-19.html\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primordial_black_hole\nhttps://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/518/1/54/6779708\nhttps://par.nsf.gov/biblio/10567988-astrometric-microlensing-primordial-black-holes-roman-space-telescope\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/385091536_On_Finding_Black_Holes_in_Photometric_Microlensing_Surveys\nhttps://arxiv.org/html/2409.04534v1\nhttps://inspirehep.net/literature/1826669\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.109.123538\nhttps://cds.cern.ch/record/2900536/files/2405.13871.pdf\nhttps://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adcec3/pdf\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.111.043043.pdf\n\n</FINAL_DETAILED_REPORT>", "marvel_deepsearch_score": 9, "evaluation_model_type": "openai", "evaluation_model_name": "gpt-4o-mini", "qa_model_type": "openai", "qa_model_name": "gpt-4o-mini", "gpt4o_mini_answer_relevancy": 0.95, "gpt4o_mini_answer_correctness": 0.88, "gpt4o_mini_faithfulness": 0.05, "marvel_standard_answer_relevancy": 0.98, "marvel_standard_answer_correctness": 0.85, "marvel_standard_faithfulness": 0.05, "marvel_deepsearch_answer_relevancy": 0.92, "marvel_deepsearch_answer_correctness": 0.87, "marvel_deepsearch_faithfulness": 0.82}

If the compactness exceeds this limit, it implies the presence of a singularity, indicating that a black hole must form.", "gpt4o_mini_answer": "Black holes are categorized based on their mass into several intervals:\n\n1. **Stellar Black Holes**: These typically have masses ranging from about 3 to 20-30 solar masses (M☉). They form from the gravitational collapse of massive stars after they exhaust their nuclear fuel.\n\n2. **Intermediate Mass Black Holes (IMBHs)**: These are less well-defined and are thought to have masses ranging from about 100 to 100,000 solar masses. They are believed to form through the merging of smaller black holes or from the direct collapse of massive stars in dense stellar environments.\n\n3. **Supermassive Black Holes (SMBHs)**: These have masses greater than about 100,000 solar masses and can reach billions of solar masses. They are typically found at the centers of galaxies, including our Milky Way, and their formation mechanisms are still an area of active research, possibly involving the merging of smaller black holes and the accretion of gas and stars over time.\n\n### Significance of the Oppenheimer-Volkoff Equation\n\nThe Oppenheimer-Volkoff (OV) equation is a fundamental equation in general relativity that describes the structure of a spherically symmetric, non-rotating star in hydrostatic equilibrium. It is particularly significant in the context of neutron stars and black holes because it relates the pressure, density, and gravitational field within a compact object.\n\nThe OV equation helps to determine the maximum mass of a neutron star, known as the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) limit, which is typically around 2 to 3 solar masses. Beyond this limit, the pressure from neutron degeneracy cannot support the star against gravitational collapse, leading to the formation of a black hole.\n\n### Compactness\n\nThe compactness of a stellar object can be defined in terms of its mass and radius. For black holes, compactness is a crucial factor because it influences the stability and the nature of the object. The compactness parameter \\( C \\) can be defined as:\n\n\\[\nC = \\frac{GM}{Rc^2}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( G \\) is the gravitational constant, \\( M \\) is the mass of the object, \\( R \\) is its radius, and \\( c \\) is the speed of light. \n\nFor black holes, as the mass increases while the radius approaches the Schwarzschild radius, the compactness increases, leading to stronger gravitational effects. This compactness is significant because it determines the event horizon's properties and the black hole's influence on surrounding matter and light. In essence, the more compact an object is, the stronger its gravitational pull, which is a key characteristic of black holes. \n\nIn summary, the mass intervals for black holes help classify them based on their formation and characteristics, while the Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation and the concept of compactness are essential for understanding the stability and nature of these extreme objects in the universe.", "gpt4o_mini_score": 9, "marvel_standard_answer": "\n- Stellar black holes: 1.4 to 20-30 solar masses (M).\n- Intermediate-mass black holes: 100 to 100,000 M.\n- Supermassive black holes: Millions to billions of M.\n- The Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation signifies the maximum compactness before collapse into a black hole or highlighting the extreme compactness of black holes.\n\n\n**Note:** This is a quick response generated by a language model, which may contain inaccuracies. \n                                                    For more detailed answers, please rephrase your question and be sure to request sources and supporting documents.\n                                                    ", "marvel_standard_score": 5, "marvel_deepsearch_answer": "KEY_FACTS\nStellar Black Holes: Have masses between \n2\n–\n150\n𝑀\n☉\n2–150M☉, with estimated masses ranging from about \n3\n3 to \n50\n50 times the mass of our sun, and a predicted maximum mass for a black hole formed from an isolated star of solar metallicity of approximately \n10\n10 solar masses.\nIntermediate-Mass Black Holes (IMBHs): Have masses in the range of \n10\n2\n–\n10\n5\n10\n2\n–10\n5\n solar masses, with descriptions of having masses between \n50\n50 to \n50\n,\n000\n50,000 times the mass of our sun, and more specifically, greater than \n100\n100 to \n300\n300 times the mass of the sun.\nSupermassive Black Holes: Have masses between \n10\n5\n–\n10\n11\n𝑀\n☉\n10\n5\n–10\n11\nM☉, ranging from millions to billions of times the mass of the sun, with ultramassive black holes having masses in the range \n10\n9\n–\n10\n11\n𝑀\n☉\n10\n9\n–10\n11\nM☉.\nThe compactness defined by the Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation, given by \n𝐺\n𝑀\n𝑅\n𝑐\n2\nRc\n2\nGM\n\t​\n\n, is significant in understanding the properties of compact objects, including black holes and neutron stars, and is crucial in determining the maximum mass limit for neutron stars, known as the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) limit [@\"url:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tolman%E2%80%93Oppenheimer%E2%80%93Volkoff_limit\"]. <TASK_OUTPUT/>\nFINER_DETAILS\n\n<TASK_OUTPUT> The mass intervals for stellar black holes, intermediate-mass black holes, and supermassive black holes are as follows:\n\nStellar Black Holes: Typically have masses up to \n10\n2\n10\n2\n solar masses, with estimated masses ranging from about \n3\n3 to \n50\n50 times the mass of our sun, and more specifically, between \n2\n–\n150\n𝑀\n☉\n2–150M☉ [@\"url:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate-mass_black_hole\",\"url:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole\"].

The compactness defined by the Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation is significant in understanding the properties of compact objects, including black holes and neutron stars. The distinct characteristics and formation mechanisms of stellar black holes, intermediate-mass black holes, and supermassive black holes are as follows: Stellar black holes are formed from the gravitational collapse of a single star, with masses ranging from about $3$ to $50$ times the mass of our sun. Intermediate-mass black holes are rare or non-existent, with masses between $50$ to $50,000$ times the mass of our sun. Supermassive black holes are found at the center of galaxies, with masses greater than $50,000$ times the mass of our sun. The Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation and compactness play a crucial role in understanding the characteristics and formation mechanisms of these black holes. The mass intervals for black holes are generally categorized as follows: - Stellar black holes: $2–150 M☉$, - Intermediate-mass black holes: $10^2–10^5 M☉$, - Supermassive black holes: $10^6–10^9 M☉$ and up to $10^{11} M☉$ for ultramassive black holes.

The mass intervals for black holes are generally categorized as follows: - Stellar black holes: $2–150 M☉$, - Intermediate-mass black holes: $10^2–10^5 M☉$, - Supermassive black holes: $10^6–10^9 M☉$ and up to $10^{11} M☉$ for ultramassive black holes. The Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation's significance lies in defining the compactness of a body, which is vital for understanding the maximum mass limits of neutron stars and the formation of black holes. The compactness defined by the Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation is significant in understanding the properties of compact objects, including black holes and neutron stars. The mass intervals for these black holes are as follows: * **Stellar Black Holes**: Typically have masses up to $10^2$ solar masses, with estimated masses ranging from about $3$ to $50$ times the mass of our sun, and more specifically, between $2–150 M☉$. * **Intermediate-Mass Black Holes (IMBHs)**: Have masses in the range of $10^2–10^5$ solar masses, and are also described as having masses between $50$ to $50,000$ times the mass of our sun. A recent study suggests that IMBHs have masses greater than $100$ to $300$ times the mass of the sun. * **Supermassive Black Holes**: Have masses between $10^5–10^9$ solar masses, and can range from millions to billions of times the mass of the sun. Ultramassive black holes have masses in the range $10^9–10^{11} M☉$.

Additionally, multi-wavelength observations over a longer timescale revealed a slow achromatic flux increase over 150 days, followed by a decline.", "gpt4o_mini_answer": "The gamma-ray burst GRB 170817A was a significant astronomical event that followed the gravitational wave event GW170817, marking the first time a gamma-ray burst was associated with a gravitational wave source. Here are the key observational features and characteristics of GRB 170817A as detected by the Fermi Space Telescope and other observatories:\n\n1. **Timing and Association**: GRB 170817A was detected on August 17, 2017, just a few seconds after the gravitational wave event GW170817, which was attributed to the merger of two neutron stars. This close temporal association provided strong evidence linking the two phenomena.\n\n2. **Duration and Spectrum**: GRB 170817A was classified as a short gamma-ray burst, with a duration of about 2 seconds. The spectrum of the burst was relatively soft compared to typical short GRBs, with a peak energy around 100 keV.\n\n3. **Location**: The burst was localized to the galaxy NGC 4993, which is located about 130 million light-years away in the Hydra constellation. This localization was crucial for follow-up observations across multiple wavelengths.\n\n4. **Afterglow Observations**: Following the initial gamma-ray emission, the afterglow of GRB 170817A was observed across the electromagnetic spectrum, including X-rays, optical, and radio wavelengths. The afterglow was detected and monitored by various telescopes, providing insights into the nature of the explosion and the environment surrounding the merger.\n\n5. **Kilonova Association**: The event was also associated with a kilonova, a transient astronomical event that occurs when neutron stars merge. The kilonova produced heavy elements through rapid neutron capture (r-process) nucleosynthesis, which was observed in the optical and infrared bands. This was the first time that a kilonova was directly linked to a gamma-ray burst.\n\n6. **Energy and Luminosity**: The energy released in GRB 170817A was significantly lower than that of typical short GRBs, with an estimated isotropic energy release of about \\( 10^{47} \\) ergs. This lower energy output was consistent with the expectations for a kilonova-associated event.\n\n7. **Multi-Messenger Astronomy**: GRB 170817A and GW170817 marked a milestone in multi-messenger astronomy, as they provided a unique opportunity to study the same astrophysical event through both gravitational waves and electromagnetic signals. This has opened new avenues for understanding the processes involved in neutron star mergers.\n\nOverall, GRB 170817A was a groundbreaking event that not only confirmed the connection between gamma-ray bursts and neutron star mergers but also provided valuable insights into the production of heavy elements in the universe.", "gpt4o_mini_score": 9, "marvel_standard_answer": "\nThe key observational features and characteristics of the gamma-ray burst GRB170817A include:\n1. **Short Gamma-Ray Burst**: GRB170817A was a short gamma-ray burst with a duration of about 2 seconds.\n2. **Soft Spectrum**: It had a softer energy spectrum.\n3. **Association with GW170817**: Detected in association with the gravitational wave event GW170817.\n\n\n**Note:** This is a quick response generated by a language model, which may contain inaccuracies. \n                                                    For more detailed answers, please rephrase your question and be sure to request sources and supporting documents.\n                                                    ", "marvel_standard_score": 5, "marvel_deepsearch_answer": "KEY_FACTS\n\n<TASK_OUTPUT>\n\nThe gamma-ray burst GRB170817A was a short-duration burst lasting about 2 seconds [@\"https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20220003070/downloads/Fermi%20Gamma-ray.pdf\"].\nIt occurred 1.7 seconds after the merger time of GW170817.\nThe burst had a spectrally hard main peak lasting ~0.5 seconds, followed by a spectrally softer tail.\nDetected in multiple energy bands by the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) and INTEGRAL SPI-ACS.\nLocalized to the S0-type galaxy NGC4993 at a distance of 40 Mpc.\nThe burst was under luminous by 3-4 orders compared to typical short gamma-ray bursts.\nThe spectrum can be described by a power-law function with an exponential high-energy cutoff: \n𝑓\n(\n𝐸\n)\n=\n𝐸\n−\n0.89\n±\n0.5\n⋅\n𝑒\n−\n𝐸\n/\n𝐸\n𝑝\n𝑒\n𝑎\n𝑘\nf(E)=E\n−0.89±0.5\n⋅e\n−E/E\npeak\n\t​\n\n where \n𝐸\n𝑝\n𝑒\n𝑎\n𝑘\n=\n82\n±\n21\nE\npeak\n\t​\n\n=82±21 keV [@\"https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20220003070/downloads/Fermi%20Gamma-ray.pdf\"].\nThe burst exhibited two distinct spectral components: a short-lasting non-thermal pulse at early times, followed by a soft thermal component.\nGRB170817A had a weak gamma-ray emission, followed by a bright optical transient, AT2017gfo.\nThe spectral characteristics included a power-law component with a spectral index of \n𝐹\n𝜈\n∝\n𝜈\n−\n0.6\nF\nν\n\t​\n\n∝ν\n−0.6\n.\nThe event fluence in the \n10\n10-\n1000\n1000 keV energy range is \n(\n2.3\n±\n0.4\n)\n×\n10\n−\n7\n(2.3±0.4)×10\n−7\n erg/cm\n2\n2\n, and the \n1.024\n1.024-sec peak photon flux in the \n8\n8-\n1000\n1000 keV band is \n1.9\n±\n0.2\n1.9±0.2 ph/s/cm\n2\n2\n. </TASK_OUTPUT>\nFINER_DETAILS\n\n<TASK_OUTPUT> The gamma-ray burst GRB170817A, detected by the Fermi space telescope following the gravitational wave event GW170817, exhibited several key observational features and characteristics.

A new mechanism proposed to address these challenges involves adding a new source of energy to the star, specifically through additional nuclear fusion, which prevents the star from completely exploding and allows for the formation of a black hole remnant instead.", "gpt4o_mini_answer": "The upper mass gap of black holes refers to the range of black hole masses that are not commonly observed, particularly between the maximum mass of neutron stars (around 2-3 solar masses) and the minimum mass of black holes that are typically formed from stellar collapse (around 5-10 solar masses). This gap presents several challenges in astrophysics, primarily because it raises questions about the formation processes of black holes and the mechanisms that lead to their growth.\n\n### Challenges Associated with Populating the Upper Mass Gap:\n\n1. **Formation Mechanisms**: The traditional understanding of black hole formation suggests that black holes form from the collapse of massive stars. However, the upper mass gap indicates that there are few black holes in the mass range of about 3 to 5 solar masses, which is puzzling. This gap suggests that there may be a lack of stable progenitor stars that can collapse into black holes of these masses.\n\n2. **Stellar Evolution**: Massive stars undergo significant mass loss through stellar winds and supernova explosions, which can prevent them from forming black holes in the upper mass gap. The processes that lead to the formation of black holes in this range are not well understood.\n\n3. **Observational Bias**: There may be observational biases that prevent the detection of black holes in the upper mass gap. For instance, many black holes are detected through their interactions with companion stars or through gravitational wave events, and those in the upper mass gap may not be easily observable.\n\n4. **Gravitational Wave Events**: The detection of gravitational waves from merging black holes has provided insights into their masses, but the observed mergers often do not include black holes in the upper mass gap, raising questions about their existence.\n\n### Proposed Mechanisms to Address These Challenges:\n\nOne proposed mechanism to populate the upper mass gap involves the **formation of black holes through the merger of neutron stars** or the merger of black holes themselves. This process can lead to the creation of more massive black holes that could fall into the upper mass gap. \n\n1. **Neutron Star Mergers**: When two neutron stars merge, they can produce a black hole that may have a mass in the upper mass gap. This scenario is supported by observations of gravitational waves from neutron star mergers, which can lead to the formation of black holes with masses that bridge the gap.\n\n2. **Black Hole Mergers**: Similarly, the merger of two black holes can result in a black hole with a mass that falls into the upper mass gap. This has been observed in gravitational wave events, where the final mass of the merged black hole can exceed the individual masses of the progenitor black holes.\n\n3. **Alternative Evolutionary Paths**: Some researchers propose that certain evolutionary paths of massive stars, particularly those that experience significant mass loss or are in binary systems, could lead to the formation of black holes in the upper mass gap. This includes scenarios where stars lose mass through interactions with companions or through other mechanisms that alter their evolutionary paths.\n\nIn summary, the challenges associated with populating the upper mass gap of black holes stem from the complexities of stellar evolution and observational limitations. Proposed mechanisms, such as neutron star mergers and black hole mergers, offer potential explanations for how black holes in this mass range could form and be detected.", "gpt4o_mini_score": 7, "marvel_standard_answer": "<QUERY> 'What challenges are associated with populating the upper mass gap of black holes, and what new mechanism has been proposed to address these challenges?' </QUERY>\n\n## Step 1: Understand the Query\nThe query asks about the challenges associated with populating the upper mass gap of black holes and the new mechanism proposed to address these challenges.\n\n## 2: Review Relevant Documents\nThe upper mass gap of black holes, also known as the pair-instability mass gap, is predicted to be around $55 M_\\odot$ to $70 M_\\odot$ or more broadly between $\\approx50-120 M_{\\odot}$. The challenges associated with populating this gap are related to the formation mechanisms of black holes, specifically through the collapse of stars at the end of their life.\n\n## 3: Identify Challenges\nThe challenges include uncertainties in input physics such as the nuclear reaction rate for burning carbon into oxygen, the treatment of convection inside stars, and the effect of rapid rotation on stars. These uncertainties individually cannot produce a black hole with a mass above about $55 M_\\odot$. The predicted gap arises from pair-instability supernovae (PISNe) and pulsational pair-instability supernovae (PPISNe), which suggest that stars in a certain mass range fully explode, leaving behind no remnant black hole.\n\n## 4: New Mechanism Proposed\nA new mechanism proposed to address these challenges involves considering the help from a star's environment and the possibility of primordial black holes formed from dense regions in the early Universe. Another proposal includes the impact of stellar rotation on the hydrodynamics of PISNe and PPISNe. Additionally, mergers of compact objects in dense clusters, such as globular clusters, are suggested as a way to form black holes within the upper mass gap. The formation of black holes through the isolated channel, the role of metallicity, and stellar evolution are also areas of study.\n\n## 5: Conclusion\nThe challenges associated with populating the upper mass gap of black holes are primarily due to the predicted formation mechanisms of black holes through stellar evolution and supernovae explosions. New mechanisms, including the role of stellar rotation, mergers in dense environments, and primordial black holes, have been proposed to address these challenges.\n\n<ANSWER> The challenges associated with populating the upper mass gap of black holes ($\\approx50-120 M_{\\odot}$) arise from uncertainties in stellar evolution models, specifically related to pair-instability supernovae (PISNe) and pulsational pair-instability supernovae (PPISNe). These processes suggest that stars within a certain mass range would fully explode without leaving a black hole remnant. A new mechanism proposed to address these challenges includes considering the effects of stellar rotation on PISNe and PPISNe, mergers of compact objects in dense stellar environments like globular clusters, and the potential role of primordial black holes. These alternatives aim to explain the observed black holes within the upper mass gap, such as those involved in the merger event GW190521. </ANSWER>\n\nSources/Citations/URL:\n- https://cplberry.com/tag/mass-gap/\n- https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ac2b27\n- https://arxiv.org/html/2412.13318v1\n- https://carnegiescience.edu/populating-upper-black-hole-mass-gap-through-stellar-collisions-young-star-clusters\n- https://www.sciencenews.org/article/biggest-black-hole-gravitational-waves\n- https://aasnova.org/2021/08/20/addressing-a-gap-in-our-knowledge-of-black-holes/\n\n# The Upper Mass Gap of Black Holes: Challenges and New Mechanisms\n====================================================================================\n\nThe population of black holes with masses between approximately $40$ and $130$ solar masses, known as the upper mass gap, poses significant challenges to our understanding of astrophysics. Theoretical modeling of massive stars predicts a gap in the black hole (BH) mass function above $\\sim40-50 M$ for BHs formed through single star evolution, arising from (pulsational) pair-instability supernovae (PISNe) [1].\n\n## Challenges in Populating the Upper Mass Gap\n--------------------------------------------\n\nThe challenges associated with populating the upper mass gap of black holes arise from the predicted gap in black hole masses between $\\sim45 M_{\\odot}$ and $120 M_{\\odot}$, referred to as the upper black hole mass-gap, due to pair-instability supernovae (PISNe) [2]. This gap is thought to exist because stars in this mass range are predicted to fully explode, leaving behind no remnant black hole.\n\n## New Mechanisms to Address the Challenges\n-----------------------------------------\n\nSeveral new mechanisms have been proposed to address these challenges. One such mechanism involves considering the help from a star's environment and the possibility of primordial black holes formed from dense regions in the early Universe [3]. Additionally, the impact of stellar rotation on the hydrodynamics of PISNe and pulsational-PISNe (PPISNe) has been proposed as a new mechanism to populate the upper mass gap [4].\n\n## The Role of Dense Star Clusters\n---------------------------------\n\nDense star clusters have been suggested as a possible solution to populate the upper mass gap. A study by Kremer et al. (2020) explored the formation of BHs with masses within or above the pair-instability gap through collisions of young massive stars in dense star clusters [5]. The simulations showed that as many as $\\sim20\\%$ of all BH progenitors undergo one or more collisions prior to stellar collapse and up to $\\sim1\\%$ of all BHs reside within or above the pair-instability gap through the effects of these collisions.\n\n## The Detection of Black Holes in the Upper Mass Gap\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nThe detection of the binary black hole merger GW190521, with primary black hole mass $85_{-14}^{+21} M_{\\odot}$, proved the existence of black holes in the upper mass gap [6]. This event raises questions about the formation mechanisms of such massive black holes, as the current understanding of stellar evolution and supernovae explosions suggests that the formation of black holes with masses between $\\approx50-120 M_{\\odot}$ is challenging.\n\n## Conclusion\n----------\n\nIn conclusion, the upper mass gap of black holes poses significant challenges to our understanding of astrophysics. New mechanisms, such as the impact of stellar rotation and the role of dense star clusters, have been proposed to address these challenges. Further detections of high-mass binaries, particularly through gravitational-wave signals, are crucial to refine constraints and distinguish between astrophysical formation channels.\n\n## References\n--------------\n\n[1] [https://carnegiescience.edu/populating-upper-black-hole-mass-gap-through-stellar-collisions-young-star-clusters](https://carnegiescience.edu/populating-upper-black-hole-mass-gap-through-stellar-collisions-young-star-clusters)\n[2] [https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2020/08/aa38902-20/aa38902-20.html](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2020/08/aa38902-20/aa38902-20.html)\n[3] [https://cplberry.com/tag/mass-gap/](https://cplberry.com/tag/mass-gap/)\n[4] [https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2020/08/aa38902-20/aa38902-20.html](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2020/08/aa38902-20/aa38902-20.html)\n[5] [https://carnegiescience.edu/populating-upper-black-hole-mass-gap-through-stellar-collisions-young-star-clusters](https://carnegiescience.edu/populating-upper-black-hole-mass-gap-through-stellar-collisions-young-star-clusters)\n[6] [https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/519/4/5191/6955699](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/519/4/5191/6955699)", "marvel_standard_score": 9, "marvel_deepsearch_answer": "The Upper Mass Gap of Black Holes: Challenges and New Mechanisms\n\n====================================================================================\n\nThe population of black holes with masses between approximately \n40\n40 and \n130\n130 solar masses, known as the upper mass gap, poses significant challenges to our understanding of astrophysics.

Additionally, the impact of stellar rotation on the hydrodynamics of PISNe and pulsational-PISNe (PPISNe) has been proposed as a new mechanism to populate the upper mass gap [4].

A study by Kremer et al. (2020) explored the formation of BHs with masses within or above the pair-instability gap through collisions of young massive stars in dense star clusters [5]. The simulations showed that as many as \n∼\n20\n%\n∼20% of all BH progenitors undergo one or more collisions prior to stellar collapse and up to \n∼\n1\n%\n∼1% of all BHs reside within or above the pair-instability gap through the effects of these collisions.\n\nStellar Evolution Models Incorporating Rapid Rotation and Binary Interactions\n\nStellar evolution models that incorporate rapid rotation and binary interactions suggest that these factors can significantly affect the formation of black holes. Rapid rotation can lead to enhanced chemical mixing, extended fuel supply, and modulation of observed magnitude and color due to gravity darkening. Binary interactions, including mass transfer, common-envelope events, and tides, can also impact the evolution of stars and the formation of black holes.\n\nThe Merger of Compact Objects in Dense Stellar Environments\n\nThe merger of compact objects in dense stellar environments, such as globular clusters, is believed to play a significant role in forming black holes within the upper mass gap. This process involves the dynamical capture and merger of black holes, which can lead to the creation of more massive black holes beyond the typical mass limits imposed by stellar evolution [6].\n\nThe Impact of Stellar Rotation on Pair-Instability Supernovae\n\nThe impact of stellar rotation on pair-instability supernovae (PISNe) plays a crucial role in populating the upper mass gap of black holes. Stellar rotation affects the hydrodynamics of PISNe, which in turn influences the formation of compact remnants. The inclusion of rotation in simulations shifts the lower edge of the upper mass-gap downwards by \n∼\n4\n%\n∼4%, while simulations without this effect shift it upwards by \n∼\n15\n%\n∼15% [7].\n\nPrimordial Black Holes and the Upper Mass Gap\n\nPrimordial black holes (PBHs) are hypothesized to have formed in the early Universe before the first stars formed. They are distinct from astrophysical black holes, which are formed through the stellar evolution and collapse of massive stars. PBHs may have a role in populating the upper mass gap, with events such as GW190521 being explainable by the PBH scenario [8]. According to an analysis extended to stars of various masses, sufficient amounts of non-nuclear energy can allow any star to form a black hole, potentially populating this gap.\n\nThe Detection of Black Holes in the Upper Mass Gap\n\nThe detection of the binary black hole merger GW190521, with primary black hole mass \n8\n5\n−\n14\n+\n21\n𝑀\n⊙\n85\n−14\n+21\n\t​\n\nM\n⊙\n\t​\n\n, proved the existence of black holes in the upper mass gap [9]. This event raises questions about the formation mechanisms of such massive black holes, as the current understanding of stellar evolution and supernovae explosions suggests that the formation of black holes with masses between \n≈\n50\n−\n120\n𝑀\n⊙\n≈50−120M\n⊙\n\t​\n\n is challenging.\n\nRecent Studies and Findings\n\nRecent studies have provided new insights into the formation of black holes within the upper mass gap. For instance, research has shown that stellar collisions in dense star clusters can produce black holes with masses exceeding the typical upper limit [10]. Additionally, the role of primordial black holes in populating the upper mass gap has been explored, suggesting that they could contribute to the observed properties of certain gravitational wave events [11].\n\nObservational Evidence\n\nThe observation of two black holes colliding, with one having a mass of \n85\n𝑀\n⊙\n85M\n⊙\n\t​\n\n, provides evidence for the existence of black holes within the upper mass gap [9]. This event suggests that stellar collisions in dense star clusters can produce black holes with masses exceeding the typical upper limit.\n\nMetallicity and Black Hole Formation\n\nMetallicity plays a significant role in the formation of black holes within the upper mass gap through stellar evolution. Lower metallicity environments are more conducive to the formation of more massive black holes, including those within the upper mass gap [12].\n\nThe Impact of Stellar Rotation\n\nStellar rotation affects the mass function of BHs in several ways. In massive metal-poor stars, fast rotation reduces the minimum zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) mass for a star to undergo pair instability and pulsational pair instability. Additionally, stellar winds are enhanced by rotation, peeling off the entire hydrogen envelope. As a consequence, the maximum BH mass from the collapse of a rotating metal-poor star is \n∼\n45\n𝑀\n⊙\n∼45M\n⊙\n\t​\n\n, while that from a nonrotating star is \n∼\n60\n𝑀\n⊙\n∼60M\n⊙\n\t​\n\n [13].\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the upper mass gap of black holes poses significant challenges to our understanding of astrophysics. New mechanisms, such as the impact of stellar rotation, the role of dense star clusters, and the merger of compact objects, have been proposed to address these challenges. The detection of black holes in the upper mass gap, such as GW190521, provides evidence for the existence of these massive black holes. Further research is needed to determine the properties and formation mechanisms of these massive black holes.\n\nReferences\n\n[1] https://carnegiescience.edu/populating-upper-black-hole-mass-gap-through-stellar-collisions-young-star-clusters [2] https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2020/08/aa38902-20/aa38902-20.html [3] https://cplberry.com/tag/mass-gap/ [4] https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2020/08/aa38902-20/aa38902-20.html [5] https://carnegiescience.edu/populating-upper-black-hole-mass-gap-through-stellar-collisions-young-star-clusters [6] https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020AAS...23536910B/abstract [7] https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.06220.pdf [8] https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221268642200084X [9] https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/519/4/5191/6955699 [10] https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025ApJ...986...82K/abstract [11] https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.109.103042 [12] https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/512/1/884/6518299 [13] http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...888...76M/abstract [14] https://www.researchgate.net/publication/384281514_The_effect_of_stellar_rotation_on_black_hole_mass_and_spin [15] https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ab584d\n\n</FINAL_DETAILED_REPORT>", "marvel_deepsearch_score": 9, "evaluation_model_type": "openai", "evaluation_model_name": "gpt-4o-mini", "qa_model_type": "openai", "qa_model_name": "gpt-4o-mini", "gpt4o_mini_answer_relevancy": 0.98, "gpt4o_mini_answer_correctness": 0.8, "gpt4o_mini_faithfulness": 0.23, "marvel_standard_answer_relevancy": 0.98, "marvel_standard_answer_correctness": 0.87, "marvel_standard_faithfulness": 0.85, "marvel_deepsearch_answer_relevancy": 0.98, "marvel_deepsearch_answer_correctness": 0.9, "marvel_deepsearch_faithfulness": 0.87}

The accuracy of these estimations depends significantly on the number of detectors used in the observation process. In this article, we will discuss the expected median uncertainty factor for component mass estimation when using a 2-instrument network compared to a 3-4-instrument network.\n\n## Uncertainty Factor and Detector Networks\n\nA study published in Phys. Rev. D95, 064052, on March 28, 2017, and available via CHORUS, examined the impact of detector networks on the estimation of black hole intrinsic masses[^1]. The research indicated that having only two detectors would result in relatively poor estimates of black hole intrinsic masses. In contrast, using three or four instruments significantly improves the estimation.\n\n## Statistical Uncertainties and Systematic Biases\n\nAnother relevant study noted that statistical uncertainties in component mass estimation decrease with increasing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), while systematic biases are independent of the signal power[^2]. This information provides insight into the factors affecting the accuracy of mass estimations but does not directly quantify the expected median uncertainty factor for 2-instrument versus 3-4-instrument networks.\n\n## Detailed Analysis with Next-Generation Detectors\n\nA more recent study focused on the detectability of intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) binary mergers and the measurability of their parameters with next-generation ground-based detector networks[^3]. Using the Fisher information matrix formalism, the study estimated errors on source-frame masses, redshift, and sky localization for binaries with component masses $m_{1,2} \\sim 1000 M_{\\odot}$. The results showed that an optimal 3-detector network can constrain the masses with errors $\\lesssim 0.1\\%$ ($\\lesssim 1\\%$) at $z = 0.5$ ($z = 2$). The low-frequency sensitivity of detectors was found to be crucial for IMBH detection and parameter estimation.\n\n## Comparison of Detector Networks\n\nThe study compared several next-generation (XG) detector networks, including 2- and 3-detector networks, and considered a CE40-CE20-ET network optimal. The CE40-ET network performed similarly to the optimal network. The results indicated that XG detectors could provide a census of the lower end of the IMBH mass spectrum, with good enough sky localization for cross-correlation with galaxy catalogs and searching for electromagnetic counterparts.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWhile the exact expected median uncertainty factor for component mass estimation when using a 2-instrument network compared to a 3-4-instrument network is not directly provided, the studies suggest that using more detectors improves the accuracy of black hole mass estimations. The detailed results and comparisons available in the referenced studies offer valuable insights into the impact of detector networks on binary black hole measurements.\n\n## References\n\n[^1]: [Phys.

Here's a breakdown of these parameters and their relationships to transformation properties:\n\n### 1. Amplitude\n- **Definition**: The amplitude of a waveform refers to the maximum value of the wave, which indicates the strength or intensity of the signal. In gravitational waves, for example, it can be related to the energy emitted by the source.\n- **Transformation Properties**: Amplitude can be affected by the distance from the source to the observer (inverse square law) and can also change due to the orientation of the source relative to the observer. In waveform space, amplitude can be scaled, and transformations may involve rescaling the amplitude based on these factors.\n\n### 2. Ellipticity\n- **Definition**: Ellipticity describes the shape of the waveform in terms of its polarization. It is often defined as the ratio of the semi-minor axis to the semi-major axis of the ellipse that represents the polarization state of the wave. In gravitational waves, ellipticity can indicate the degree of non-circular polarization.\n- **Transformation Properties**: Ellipticity can change under rotations and transformations of the coordinate system. For example, if the wave is observed from a different angle, the apparent ellipticity may change. This is important in analyzing the polarization states of waves and understanding how they transform under different observational conditions.\n\n### 3. Phase Angles\n- **Definition**: Phase angles indicate the position of a point in time on the waveform cycle. They are crucial for determining the timing of the wave's peaks and troughs. In a sinusoidal wave, the phase can be expressed in radians or degrees.\n- **Transformation Properties**: Phase angles can be affected by time shifts (delays) and can also change due to Doppler effects if the source is moving relative to the observer. In waveform space, phase shifts can be represented as transformations that rotate the waveform in the complex plane.\n\n### Relationships and Transformations\n- **Waveform Representation**: In waveform space, a signal can often be represented as a complex function, where amplitude, phase, and ellipticity can be encoded in the parameters of this function. For example, a complex representation might look like \\( A e^{i(\\phi + \\theta)} \\), where \\( A \\) is the amplitude, \\( \\phi \\) is the phase, and \\( \\theta \\) relates to ellipticity.\n- **Transformation Properties**: When analyzing waveforms, transformations such as Fourier transforms can be used to convert time-domain signals into frequency-domain representations. These transformations preserve the relationships between amplitude, phase, and ellipticity, allowing for the analysis of how these parameters change under different conditions (e.g., different reference frames or observational perspectives).\n\nIn summary, amplitude, ellipticity, and phase angles are fundamental parameters in waveform space that characterize the properties of waves.

These parameters are essential in describing the characteristics of waves and their transformation properties.\n\nDefinition of Parameters\n\nThe amplitude, ellipticity, and phase angles can be defined by several parameters:\n\nAmplitude: Represented by \n𝐴\n≥\n0\nA≥0, which defines the magnitude of the wave.\nEllipticity: Defined by \n−\n1\n≤\n𝜖\n≤\n1\n−1≤ϵ≤1, which describes the shape of the polarization ellipse.\nPhase Angles: Represented by \n0\n≤\n𝜃\n<\n2\n𝜋\n0≤θ<2π and \n0\n≤\n𝜙\n<\n2\n𝜋\n0≤ϕ<2π, which determine the orientation of the polarization ellipse.\n\nThese parameters are related to the axial ratio, ellipticity angle, and tilt angle. The axial ratio \n𝐴\n𝑅\n=\n𝑎\n/\n𝑏\nAR=a/b is defined as the ratio of the semi-major axis \n𝑎\na to the semi-minor axis \n𝑏\nb of the polarization ellipse and is always greater than or equal to one. The ellipticity angle \n𝜖\nϵ is defined by \ntan\n⁡\n𝜖\n=\n∓\n𝑏\n𝑎\ntanϵ=∓\na\nb\n\t​\n\n and always lies in the range \n−\n𝜋\n/\n4\n≤\n𝜖\n≤\n𝜋\n/\n4\n−π/4≤ϵ≤π/4. The tilt angle \n𝜏\nτ is defined as the positive (counterclockwise) rotation angle from the \n𝑥\nx-axis to the semi-major axis of the ellipse.\n\nRelationship to Transformation Properties\n\nThe transformation properties of these parameters are discussed in various contexts, including seismic waveform analysis, wave propagation, and polarization.\n\nIn seismic waveform analysis, factors associated with the amplitude and phase behavior of the waveform along the diffraction hyperbola are considered. The Society of Exploration Geophysicists (SEG) wiki page provides detailed information on these factors.\nIn wave propagation, the parameters defining the amplitude, ellipticity, and phase angles are related to the eigenvector and its corresponding eigenvalues. Specifically, the ellipticity, dip, and arrival angle of the ellipse of the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue are represented.\nIn polarization, the parameters \n𝐸\n𝑥\nEx, \n𝐸\n𝑦\nEy, and \n𝜙\nϕ define the amplitude, ellipticity, and phase angles. The general parameterization of polarization is given by \n𝐸\n⃗\n0\n=\n𝐸\n𝑥\n𝑥\nˆ\n𝑐\n𝑜\n𝑠\n(\n𝑘\n𝑧\n−\n𝜔\n𝑡\n)\n+\n𝐸\n𝑦\n𝑦\nˆ\n𝑐\n𝑜\n𝑠\n(\n𝑘\n𝑧\n−\n𝜔\n𝑡\n+\n𝜑\n)\nE⃗\n0\n\t​\n\n=Exxˆcos(kz−ωt)+Eyyˆcos(kz−ωt+φ).\nApplications and Observations\n\nThe parameters defining the amplitude, ellipticity, and phase angles have various applications and have been observed in different phenomena.\n\nA universal property of the resulting THz waveforms is that the ellipticity of their polarization state increases linearly with frequency.\nA Pc5 event observed in the outer magnetosphere by ISEE1 and2 shows highly elliptical polarization, with the disturbance vectors tracing long, narrow, irregular patterns confined almost entirely to the planes of maximal variance.\nThe wave event is described in terms of its frequency spectra, polarization, and phase reversal. The frequency spectra show peaks at 4.0 and 6.0 mHz.\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the parameters defining the amplitude, ellipticity, and phase angles in the context of waveform space are essential in understanding various phenomena in physics.

The strain measured by these detectors is not uniform across all angles; instead, it varies based on the orientation of the detector arms relative to the source of the gravitational waves. Understanding this angular dependence is crucial for accurately interpreting the data and determining the properties of the source.\n\n2. **Source Localization**: The angular dependence helps in localizing the source of the gravitational waves. By analyzing the strain data from multiple detectors, scientists can triangulate the position of the GW source in the sky. The differences in strain measurements due to angular dependence allow for the construction of a \"sky map\" that indicates where the source is likely located.\n\n3. **Polarization States**: Gravitational waves can have different polarization states (plus and cross polarizations). The angular dependence of the strain can provide insights into the polarization of the waves, which is important for understanding the nature of the source, such as whether it is a binary black hole merger, neutron star merger, or another astrophysical event.\n\n4. **Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)**: The angular dependence affects the signal-to-noise ratio of the detected gravitational waves. Depending on the orientation of the source relative to the detector, the SNR can vary significantly. This variation must be accounted for in the analysis to ensure that the detection and characterization of the gravitational wave signals are robust.\n\n5. **Modeling and Simulation**: When simulating gravitational wave signals from astrophysical sources, the angular dependence must be incorporated into the models. This ensures that the simulations accurately reflect the expected strain patterns for different orientations and distances, which is essential for comparing observed data with theoretical predictions.\n\n6. **Multi-Messenger Astronomy**: In the context of multi-messenger astronomy, where gravitational waves are observed alongside electromagnetic signals (like gamma-ray bursts), the angular dependence plays a role in correlating the two types of signals. Understanding the directionality of the gravitational waves can help identify potential electromagnetic counterparts and enhance our understanding of the underlying astrophysical processes.\n\nIn

understanding the properties of gravitational waves (GWs) and their interaction with detectors. The analysis of measured strain in gravitational wave data involves a correlation function that can be broken down into two matrices, one comprising all angular dependence of the correlation function and the other all temporal behavior. The angular dependence is significant because it reveals more information about the physical processes that generated the gravitational-wave background, improves the accuracy of distance determination and angular resolution, and provides insights into the properties of the sources and the behavior of gravitational waves as they interact with detectors. The antenna pattern factors \n𝐹\n+\nF\n+\n\t​\n\n and \n𝐹\n×\nF\n×\n\t​\n\n, which depend on the three angles defining the sky position and polarization basis, play a significant role in describing the angular dependence of gravitational wave strain in detector response. The study of angular dependence in gravitational wave data can provide insights into the properties of the sources, such as binary black hole merger sources, and the behavior of gravitational waves as they interact with detectors. The angular power spectrum of the anisotropic stochastic gravitational wave background is given by \n𝐶\n𝑙\nC\nl\n\t​\n\n, and its analytic expression has been derived [@\"url:https://inspirehep.net/literature/2636369\"]. The angular dependence of gravitational wave strain impacts the characterization of sources, such as binary black hole merger sources, in several ways, including estimation of source properties [@\"url:https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20080039132/downloads/20080039132.pdf\"], recoil velocity or gravitational kick [@\"url:https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/1806.11160.pdf\"], and selection bias [@\"url:https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/1610.06914.pdf\"]. The finite armlength effect, going beyond the long wavelength approximation, improves the accuracy of distance determination and angular resolution [@\"url:https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjc/s10052-020-7881-2\"]. Moreover, the polarisation of the wave, determined by the orientation of the line of sight with respect to the orbital plane, is crucial [@\"url:https://www.mdpi.com/2218-1997/11/8/244\"]. The angular dependence is also related to the response of the instrument when the armlength is finite, which depends strongly on the location of the source. A network of space-based gravitational wave detectors can dramatically improve the sky localization accuracy. Knowing the sky position of the source from electromagnetic data can reduce the GW parameter uncertainty up to a factor of \n∼\n2\n∼2. The implications of angular dependence in gravitational wave data analysis for the detection and characterization of gravitational wave sources with finite armlength detectors are significant, including the improvement in sky localization accuracy and the reduction in GW parameter uncertainty. The correlation function can be factorized into two parts, one containing the angular dependence and the other the temporal dependence. The phase difference \n𝛿\n𝜙\nδϕ varies as a nonlinear and complicated function of arm-length \n𝐿\nL when the incident wave carries angular momentum and hence a beam of polarization. The operating principle of the antenna is governed by an equation that shows its direct relation with the direction to an incoming GW. The differences in strain due to angular dependence can be exploited to estimate source properties for sufficiently strong binary black hole sources. The anisotropic gravitational radiation emitted by coalescing binary black holes causes a net emission of linear momentum, producing a gradual acceleration of the source, and resulting in a final remnant black hole acquiring a characteristic velocity known as recoil velocity or gravitational kick. An expected selection bias exists toward higher mass systems, and events with angular momentum oriented away from Earth are favored, while quiet events are much more numerous than loud events [@\"url:https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20080039132/downloads/20080039132.pdf\",\"url:https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/1806.11160.pdf\",\"url:https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/1610.06914.pdf\",\"url:https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjc/s10052-020-7881-2\",\"url:https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-55671-9.pdf\",\"url:https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.106.024004\",\"url:https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2013/05/aa21123-13/aa21123-13.html\"].

Additionally, the finite armlength effect introduces an additional dependence on the direction of the wave propagation, which is tightly correlated with the distance and the direction of the orbital angular momentum. The response of a detector with finite arm-length depends strongly on the direction of the source \nΩ\n𝑠\nΩ\ns\n\t​\n\n. The finite armlength effect modifies the detector response function, particularly at high frequencies where the long-wavelength approximation breaks down. For example, for a 40 km long detector, the long-wavelength approximation breaks down at high frequencies, and the measured strain depends not only on when wavefronts pass through the vertex of the interferometer but also when it passes through the ends of the arms. The finite armlength effect impacts the angular dependence of gravitational wave strain in detector response, causing variations in the strain due to the detector's arm length and the direction of the gravitational wave propagation. The angular dependence is significant because it reveals more information about the physical processes that generated the gravitational-wave background. For instance, an alternative approach to analyzing gravitational-wave backgrounds, based on the formalism used to characterize the polarization of the cosmic microwave background, decomposes an arbitrary background into modes whose angular dependence on the sky is given by gradients, allowing for the potential to reveal much more about the physical processes that generated it. The antenna pattern factors \n𝐹\n+\nF\n+\n\t​\n\n and \n𝐹\n×\nF\n×\n\t​\n\n are given by \n𝐹\n+\n=\n𝑑\n↔\n:\n𝑒\n↔\n+\n=\n𝑑\n𝑎\n𝑏\n𝑒\n+\n𝑎\n𝑏\nF+=d↔:e↔+=dabe+ab and \n𝐹\n×\n=\n𝑑\n↔\n:\n𝑒\n↔\n×\n=\n𝑑\n𝑎\n𝑏\n𝑒\n×\n𝑎\n𝑏\nF×=d↔:e↔×=dabe×ab, and for a given detector at a given time, they depend on the three angles defining the sky position and polarization basis with respect to some reference system, such as right ascension, declination, and the polarization angle \n𝜓\nψ. The polarisation matrix \n𝐴\n𝑖\n𝑗\n(\n𝑡\n)\nAij(t) depends on the angle \n𝜔\n𝐾\n𝑡\nω\nK\n\t​\n\nt, and the \n𝐴\n𝑇\n𝑇\n𝑖\n𝑗\nATT\nij\n\t​\n\n term, which is part of equation (1.24), also depends on this orientation. Researchers have developed statistical methods to analyze data from ground-based detectors, such as LIGO and VIRGO, to study the anisotropy of the astrophysical gravitational wave background. The angular dependence of gravitational wave strain plays a significant role in characterizing the polarization properties of gravitational waves and their interaction with detectors. This dependence influences how gravitational waves interact with detectors, affecting the detection and analysis of these waves. The interaction of gravitational waves with detectors is manifested as fluctuations in the arm length between two detectors, with the intensity of the detector's response depending on the angle between the gravitational wave propagation direction and the detector arm. The antenna pattern functions provide the dependence on the wave propagation direction, the polarization orientation angle, and the detector geometry. The strain measured by a detector is given by \nℎ\n=\nℎ\n+\n𝐹\n+\n+\nℎ\n×\n𝐹\n×\nh=h\n+\n\t​\n\nF\n+\n\t​\n\n+h\n×\n\t​\n\nF\n×\n\t​\n\n, where \n𝐹\n+\nF\n+\n\t​\n\n and \n𝐹\n×\nF\n×\n\t​\n\n are the antenna pattern factors that depend on the three angles defining the sky position and polarization basis. The correlation function \n𝑀\n𝑖\n𝑗\n=\n𝐹\n𝑖\n(\nΩ\n1\n)\n𝐹\n𝑗\n(\nΩ\n2\n)\nMij=Fi(Ω1)Fj(Ω2) comprises all angular dependence and does not depend on the delay times or the gravitational wave strain. The angular dependence of gravitational wave strain is crucial in characterizing the polarization properties of gravitational waves. The polarization of a gravitational wave is analogous to that of a light wave, with the polarizations of the gravitational wave being \n45\n45 degrees apart, as opposed to \n90\n90 degrees. The polarizations of gravitational waves can be expressed in terms of circularly polarized waves and are determined by the nature of their source. The role of angular dependence in characterizing gravitational waves involves understanding how the strain of gravitational waves interacts with detectors. The magnitude and phase of the correlation function are given by \n𝐶\n~\n(\n𝜔\n)\n=\n𝑅\n(\n𝜔\n)\n𝑒\n𝑖\n𝜒\n(\n𝜔\n)\nC\n~\n(ω)=R(ω)e\niχ(ω)\n. The matrix \n𝑀\nM dependents on the location of the source of gravitational waves on the sky (angles \n𝜃\nθ and \n𝜑\nφ) and its polarization (angle \n𝜓\nψ). The amplitude of the strain in each arm of an interferometer depends on the arrival direction and polarization of the gravitational wave. General relativity predicts two possible orientations for the stretching and shrinking, described as two \"polarization states,\" which can be produced by a given source, either one or a combination of both, depending on the particular motions of matter in directions transverse to the line of sight.

The polarisation matrix \n𝐴\n𝑖\n𝑗\n(\n𝑡\n)\nAij(t) depends on the angle \n𝜔\n𝐾\n𝑡\nω\nK\n\t​\n\nt, and the \n𝐴\n𝑇\n𝑇\n𝑖\n𝑗\nATT\nij\n\t​\n\n term, which is part of equation (1.24), also depends on this orientation.\n\nThe study of angular dependence in gravitational wave data can provide insights into the properties of the sources, such as binary black hole merger sources, and the behavior of gravitational waves as they interact with detectors.\n\nThe implications of angular dependence in gravitational wave data analysis for the detection and characterization of gravitational wave sources with finite armlength detectors are:\n\nThe accuracy of distance determination and angular resolution improve when considering the effect of finite armlength, going beyond the long wavelength approximation.\nA network of space-based gravitational wave detectors can dramatically improve the sky localization accuracy.\nKnowing the sky position of the source from electromagnetic data can reduce GW parameter uncertainty up to a factor of \n∼\n2\n∼2.\n\nThe angular dependence of gravitational wave strain impacts the characterization of sources, such as binary black hole merger sources, in gravitational wave data analysis in several ways:\n\nEstimation of source properties: The differences in strain due to angular dependence can be exploited to estimate source properties for sufficiently strong binary black hole sources [2]. For instance, by making use of the rich information encoded in higher-order mode gravitational wave emission, it is possible to infer the component kick along the line-of-sight (or radial kick). This is demonstrated through parameter inference using a simulated signal given a numerical relativity waveform for a non-spinning binary, and a numerical relativity template for an aligned-spin (non-precessing) binary black hole [3].\nRecoil velocity or gravitational kick: The anisotropic gravitational radiation emitted by coalescing binary black holes causes a net emission of linear momentum, producing a gradual acceleration of the source, and resulting in a final remnant black hole acquiring a characteristic velocity known as recoil velocity or gravitational kick [1].\nSelection bias: There is an expected selection bias toward higher mass systems, and events with angular momentum oriented away from Earth are favored, while quiet events are much more numerous than loud events [4].\n\nIn conclusion, the significance of angular dependence in gravitational wave data analysis is crucial in understanding the physical processes that generated the gravitational-wave background. The angular dependence reveals more information about the source of the gravitational waves and its properties.\n\n</TASK_OUTPUT>\n\nREFERENCES\n\n<TASK_OUTPUT>\n\n[1] https://dcc.ligo.org/LIGO-T1300666/public\n[2] https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014PhRvD..90h2001G\n[3] https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.104.063025\n[4] https://dcc.ligo.org/public/0027/T030215/000/T030215-00.pdf\n[5] https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjc/s10052-020-7881-2\n[6] https://www.mdpi.com/2218-1997/11/8/244\n[7] https://inspirehep.net/literature/2636369\n[8] https://arxiv.org/html/2504.01809v1\n[9] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_wave\n[10] https://arxiv.org/html/2504.13115v1\n[11] https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.97.123527\n[12] https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.98.044025\n[13] https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.109.124045\n[14] https://pure.mpg.de/rest/items/item_800588/component/file_1002620/content\n[15] https://hal.science/hal-00710461/file/PEER_stage2_10.1088%252F0264-9381%252F28%252F12%252F125023.pdf\n[16] https://www.emis.de/journals/LRG/Articles/lrr-2013-9/articlese3.html\n[17] https://arxiv.org/pdf/gr-qc/9704069.pdf\n[18] https://dcc.ligo.org/LIGO-G1400227/public\n[19] https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20080039132/downloads/20080039132.pdf\n[20] https://www.nature.com/articles/s42005-020-00446-7.pdf\n[21] https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/1806.11160.pdf\n[22] https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/1610.06914.pdf\n[23] https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5253919\n[24] https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-55671-9.pdf\n[25] https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.106.024004\n[26] https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2013/05/aa21123-13/aa21123-13.html\n[27] https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.85.043005 </TASK_OUTPUT>", "marvel_deepsearch_score": 9, "evaluation_model_type": "openai", "evaluation_model_name": "gpt-4o-mini", "qa_model_type": "openai", "qa_model_name": "gpt-4o-mini", "gpt4o_mini_answer_relevancy": 0.98, "gpt4o_mini_answer_correctness": 0.98, "gpt4o_mini_faithfulness": 0.92, "marvel_standard_answer_relevancy": 0.9, "marvel_standard_answer_correctness": 0.85, "marvel_standard_faithfulness": 0.8, "marvel_deepsearch_answer_relevancy": 0.98, "marvel_deepsearch_answer_correctness": 0.98, "marvel_deepsearch_faithfulness": 0.98}

Researchers have been exploring the possibility that some of these mergers could be associated with active galactic nuclei (AGN)-assisted host galaxies.\n\n### Current Constraints and Expectations\n\nCurrent constraints suggest that approximately 20-30% of LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA (LVK) binary black hole (BBH) mergers might occur in active galactic nuclei (AGN) disks. Depending on the fraction of LVK BBHs that induce flares, it is expected to constrain $H_0$ at the ~6-7% (~4-5%) precision with ~2-3 years or ~160-240 events (~1 year or 500 events) of LVK at design (A+) sensitivity, assuming that systematic BBH follow-up searches are performed. In a scenario where only ~1% of the BBHs induce detectable flares, it is possible to achieve an $H_0$ precision from 7.5% to 15% with ~240 events. A ~5-27% precision is achievable with complete AGN catalogs and 1 year of LVK run, without the need of any flare identification.

This analysis involves 78 mergers and utilizes up-to-date posterior samples. [3]\n\n### Exploring AGN Host Galaxy Properties\n\nThe estimated fraction of LIGO/Virgo's detected binary black hole mergers that could be associated with AGN-assisted host galaxies and the expected number of such events considering the current gravitational-wave transient catalog are also explored in the context of AGN host galaxy properties, AGN lifetime, and a specified cosmological model.

These analyses combine data from various observable phenomena, providing a comprehensive view of astrophysical processes and allowing cross-validation and revealing new information.\n\nInsights into Astrophysical Sources\n\nThe detection of gravitational waves and neutrinos from these sources provides complementary insights into their physics. Neutrinos are elementary particles produced in the compact cores and outskirts of dense astrophysical sources, carrying information about the source physics and nucleosynthesis. The modeling of neutrino physics and weak interactions is advancing, particularly in the context of neutron-star merger remnants and massive star explosions.\n\nCore-Collapse Supernovae\n\nCore-collapse supernovae are considered fascinating astrophysical objects for multimessenger studies.

The primary astrophysical sources targeted include supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, binary neutron star and black hole mergers, blazars, active galactic nuclei, and tidal disruption events. The combined analysis of gravitational wave and neutrino signals can provide insights into core-collapse supernovae, proto-neutron star oscillations, black hole mergers, neutron star coalescence, and high-energy astrophysical sources.\n\nReferences\nMultimessenger Astronomy with analysis of gravitational waves and neutrinos using multivariate statistical methods\nMultimessenger Sources of Gravitational Waves and High-energy Neutrinos: Science Reach and Analysis Method\nThe power of multimessenger astrophysics\nMultimessenger science reach and analysis method for common sources of gravitational waves and high-energy neutrinos\nIceCube Neutrino Observatory\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1387647320300713\nhttps://www.frontiersin.org/journals/astronomy-and-space-sciences/articles/10.3389/fspas.2021.656907/full\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.108.063020\nhttps://inspirehep.net/literature/1753989\nhttps://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8507144/ </FINAL_DETAILED_REPORT>", "marvel_deepsearch_score": 8, "evaluation_model_type": "openai", "evaluation_model_name": "gpt-4o-mini", "qa_model_type": "openai", "qa_model_name": "gpt-4o-mini", "gpt4o_mini_answer_relevancy": 0.95, "gpt4o_mini_answer_correctness": 0.9, "gpt4o_mini_faithfulness": 0.0, "marvel_standard_answer_relevancy": 0.98, "marvel_standard_answer_correctness": 0.9, "marvel_standard_faithfulness": 0.95, "marvel_deepsearch_answer_relevancy": 0.95, "marvel_deepsearch_answer_correctness": 0.92, "marvel_deepsearch_faithfulness": 0.92}

Additionally, the spectrum is predicted to have an exponential cut-off corresponding to the rest-frame temperature of the layer with the highest post-shock velocity.", "gpt4o_mini_answer": "The light-travel-time effect has significant implications for the observed spectrum of photons from shocks in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Here are some key points to consider:\n\n1. **Time Delay and Spectrum Shifts**: The light-travel-time effect refers to the time it takes for light to travel from the source of the GRB to the observer. This can lead to a delay in the arrival of photons emitted at different times during the burst. As a result, the observed spectrum can be affected by the varying distances that photons have traveled, which can lead to a smearing of spectral features and potentially alter the perceived energy distribution of the emitted photons.\n\n2. **Redshift Effects**: If the GRB is located at a significant distance, the expansion of the universe can cause redshift, which affects the observed energy of the photons. The light-travel-time effect can exacerbate this by causing photons emitted later in the burst to be redshifted more than those emitted earlier, leading to a distortion in the observed spectrum.\n\n3. **Temporal Structure of the Burst**: GRBs often exhibit complex temporal structures, with multiple peaks and varying intensities. The light-travel-time effect can cause different parts of the burst to be observed at different times, which can complicate the interpretation of the spectrum. For instance, if a shock wave is propagating through the surrounding medium, the light-travel-time effect can lead to a situation where the observer sees a sequence of spectral features that do not correspond to the instantaneous state of the shock.\n\n4. **Spectral Evolution**: The light-travel-time effect can influence the spectral evolution of the GRB. As the shock propagates and interacts with the surrounding medium, the spectrum may change over time. The observer may see a combination of spectra from different times, leading to a more complex overall spectrum than would be expected from a simple model.\n\n5. **Implications for Modeling and Interpretation**: When modeling GRBs and interpreting their spectra, it is crucial to account for the light-travel-time effect. This includes considering how the time delays affect the observed spectral features and how they might influence the inferred physical parameters of the GRB, such as the energy output, the composition of the ejecta, and the dynamics of the shock.\n\n6. **Distance and Cosmological Considerations**: For distant GRBs, the light-travel-time effect can also introduce additional complexities related to cosmological distances. The finite speed of light means that the observed properties of GRBs can be influenced by the expansion of the universe, leading to potential misinterpretations if not properly accounted for.\n\nIn summary, the light-travel-time effect plays a crucial role in shaping the observed spectrum of photons from GRBs, affecting the timing, redshift, and overall spectral characteristics. Understanding these implications is essential for accurately interpreting GRB observations and for developing models that describe their underlying physics.", "gpt4o_mini_score": 9, "marvel_standard_answer": "The light-travel-time effect can cause distortions in the observed spectrum of photons from a shock in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), potentially leading to incorrect conclusions about the shock's properties and the GRB's distance.

This effect, combined with the relativistic Doppler effect and the finite speed of light, leads to the emitting region being inferred as much smaller than its actual size.\n\nUnderstanding the Light-Travel-Time Effect\n\nThe light-travel-time effect causes an observer to see contributions from ejecta with a range of different temperatures at a given time. This is due to the non-negligible difference in the arrival time of light from different parts of the breakout surface. As a result, the observed spectrum can be modified from a simple blackbody or free-free spectrum 1.\n\nImpact on Observed Spectrum\n\nThe observed X-ray spectrum can be a multitemperature blend of blackbody and free–free components due to the effects of light traveltime 2. The light-travel-time effect also influences the observed spectrum through high-latitude emission from the jet wings, which arrives later due to the longer path that photons travel, potentially producing a low-luminosity, fast-fading X-ray transient 3.\n\nRelationship with Curvature Effect\n\nThe implications of the light-travel-time effect are related to the curvature effect, which causes a rapid decrease in brightness in the lab frame of the GRB to be smeared out in the observer frame due to the different arrival times of photons. This results in a decay of \n𝛼\n=\n2\n+\n𝛽\n𝑋\n≈\n2.5\nα=2+β\nX\n\t​\n\n≈2.5, where \n𝛽\n𝑋\n≈\n0.5\nβ\nX\n\t​\n\n≈0.5 is the X-ray spectrum 3.\n\nEmission Mechanisms and Observed Properties\n\nThe light-travel-time effect, along with other factors such as curvature effects, can influence the observed properties of GRBs, including their peak energy, hardness-ratio, low and high-energy spectral indices, which are coupled to the burst duration or the light curve shape 4. Different emission mechanisms, such as synchrotron radiation and inverse Compton scattering, may concur to produce the observed signal and its temporal and spectral signatures over the keV–MeV energy range during the prompt phase.\n\nSpecific Observational Signatures\n\nThe specific observational signatures of the light-travel-time effect on the spectral indices and peak energy of gamma-ray bursts include:\n\nA tendency for \n𝛼\n𝐿\n𝐿\n𝐸\nα\nLLE\n\t​\n\n to be approximately ∈(−2, −2.5) or higher when \n𝜏\n14\n<\n0\nτ\n14\n\t​\n\n<0.\n𝛼\n𝐿\n𝐿\n𝐸\nα\nLLE\n\t​\n\n becoming smaller than ∼−2 in a larger fraction of events when \n𝜏\n14\n>\n0\nτ\n14\n\t​\n\n>0.\nPositive lags arising from curvature effects, where photons from higher latitudes of the jet emitting surface reach the observer delayed and shifted towards lower energies due to relativistic effects.\nRelationships between the burst duration, light curve shape, peak energy, hardness-ratio, and low and high-energy spectral indices.\nInfluence on Peak Energy and Low-Energy Spectral Index\n\nThe light-travel-time effect influences the observed relationship between the peak energy and the low-energy spectral index of gamma-ray bursts in two main ways:\n\nIt causes an overall softening of the GRB spectra with time.\nIt leads to a delay in the arrival of low-energy photons.\n\nThese findings are supported by studies from Fenimore et al. (1996), D. Kocevski (2003), and a more recent study on162 gamma-ray bursts observed by the Swift/BAT satellite between2011 and2019.\n\nCalculations and Theoretical Framework\n\nThe light travel time difference between a photon originating from \n𝑟\n=\n0\nr=0 and a photon originating from matter which has moved to a radius \n𝑟\nr with a Lorentz factor \nΓ\nΓ is \nΔ\n𝑡\n∼\n(\n𝑟\n/\n𝑐\n)\n(\n1\n−\n𝛽\n)\n∼\n𝑟\n/\n2\n𝑐\nΓ\n2\nΔt∼(r/c)(1−β)∼r/2cΓ\n2\n. The emission from a photosphere or from a shock emission region at radius \n𝑟\nr moving at constant \nΓ\nΓ is also received from within the causal light cone angle \nΓ\n−\n1\nΓ\n−1\n on an observer angular timescale \n𝑡\nt, which differs from \n𝑡\nt by the Doppler effect 5.\n\nInfluence on Temporal Evolution of Spectral Properties\n\nThe light-travel-time effect influences the temporal evolution of the observed spectral properties of gamma-ray bursts, particularly in terms of peak energy and hardness ratio, by causing a curvature effect that leads to a peak in the evolutionary curve of the pure hardness ratio. The peak energy of the non-blackbody component decreases rapidly with time, following a power-law decline. This effect can be understood through semi-analytical models within the internal shock model.\n\nCase Study: GRB060218\n\nThe X-ray spectrum of GRB060218 features a non-blackbody component with a peak energy that decreased rapidly with time as \n𝑡\n−\n1.4\nt\n−1.4\n or \n𝑡\n−\n1.6\nt\n−1.6\n, and a photon index that changes from \n𝛼\n𝐵\n≈\n−\n1.1\nα\nB\n\t​\n\n≈−1.1 below the break to \n𝛽\n𝐵\n≈\n2.5\nβ\nB\n\t​\n\n≈2.5 above the break. This is in contrast to the temperature of the blackbody component, which remained almost constant during the early evolution, as reported in an article on Oxford Academic.\n\nNew Insights and Additional References\n\nRecent studies have further explored the implications of the light-travel-time effect on GRBs. For instance, 6 and 7 provide additional insights into the effects of light travel time on the observed properties of GRBs.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the implications of the light-travel-time effect on the observed spectrum of photons from a shock in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are complex and multifaceted. Further research is needed to fully understand the underlying mechanisms and their contributions to the observed properties of GRBs.\n\nReferences\n\n[1] https://arxiv.org/html/2412.06736v1 [2] https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/542/2/1269/8232681 [3] https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05327-3 [4] https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2025/05/aa54053-25/aa54053-25.html [5] https://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/Sept06/Meszaros/Meszaros4.html [6] https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.74.063005?ft=1 [7] https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/342/2/587/1029605 [8] https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/518732/pdf [9] https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad0f24/pdf [10] https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/342271/fulltext\n\n</FINAL_DETAILED_REPORT> </end_header_id|end_header_id|", "marvel_deepsearch_score": 9, "evaluation_model_type": "openai", "evaluation_model_name": "gpt-4o-mini", "qa_model_type": "openai", "qa_model_name": "gpt-4o-mini", "gpt4o_mini_answer_relevancy": 0.98, "gpt4o_mini_answer_correctness": 0.87, "gpt4o_mini_faithfulness": 0.22, "marvel_standard_answer_relevancy": 0.92, "marvel_standard_answer_correctness": 0.7, "marvel_standard_faithfulness": 0.8, "marvel_deepsearch_answer_relevancy": 0.98, "marvel_deepsearch_answer_correctness": 0.895, "marvel_deepsearch_faithfulness": 0.87}

This article aims to provide an overview of the current understanding of the merger rate of BHBs.\n\n## Merger Rate Estimates\n\nThe estimated merger rate of BHBs in the local universe varies across different studies. Some estimates include:\n* $17.9\\,\\,-\\,\\,44\\,\\mathrm{Gpc}^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ at a fiducial redshift $z =0.2$ [1]\n* $14\\,\\mathrm{Gpc}^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, with a reasonable range of $4-18\\,\\mathrm{Gpc}^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ [2]\n* $2--53$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ (comoving frame) [3]\n* $13--600$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ depending on assumptions about the BBH mass distribution [3]\n* $10_{-5}^{+6}\\,\\textrm{Gpc}^{-3}\\textrm{yr}^{-1}$ [4]\n\n## Comparison to LIGO-Virgo Data\n\nThe LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) Collaboration has reported on the BHB merger rate, which is found to be between $17.9$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ and $44$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ at a fiducial redshift ($z =0.2$) [5]. The merger rate density of binary black holes in the local universe within a redshift of $0.1$ is estimated to be $13--57$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ [6].\n\n## Merger Rate Density\n\nThe local merger rate density for primordial binary black hole (BBH) mergers is estimated to be $0.18–1.8$ Gpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$, while for other BBH mergers, it is estimated to be $0.6–18$ Gpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$ [7].\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe estimated merger rate of binary black holes in the local universe varies across different studies, but generally falls within the range of $10$ to $100$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$. The merger rate inferred from LIGO-Virgo data is consistent with these estimates, but with some uncertainties.\n\n## References\n\n[1] https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-024-02338-0\n[2] https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/aae377\n[3] https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.03842\n[4] https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjc/s10052-023-11323-2\n[5] https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2022/10/aa44257-22/aa44257-22.html\n[6] https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.02058.pdf\n[7] https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/480/4/5645/5075595\n\n</ARTICLE>", "marvel_standard_score": 8, "marvel_deepsearch_answer": "Estimated Merger Rate of Binary Black Holes in the Local Universe\n\nThe estimated merger rate of binary black holes (BBHs) in the local universe is approximately \n10\n10 to \n50\n50 Gpc\n−\n3\n−3\n yr\n−\n1\n−1\n.

However, this condition needs to be verified on a case-by-case basis to ensure the approximation holds.", "gpt4o_mini_answer": "In the context of gravitational waves and self-accelerating backgrounds, particularly in modified theories of gravity, there are several conditions that need to be satisfied for a self-accelerating solution to exist. These conditions are often derived from the equations governing the dynamics of the gravitational field and the matter content of the universe. Here are the key conditions:\n\n1. **Energy Conditions**: The energy conditions, particularly the weak energy condition (WEC) and the strong energy condition (SEC), play a crucial role. For a self-accelerating solution, the SEC is typically violated. This violation allows for the existence of solutions that can accelerate without the need for a cosmological constant or other forms of dark energy.\n\n2. **Stability**: The self-accelerating background must be stable under small perturbations. This means that the perturbations should not lead to runaway solutions or instabilities that would invalidate the self-accelerating nature of the background.\n\n3. **Perturbation Theory**: The background must support perturbations that propagate as gravitational waves. This involves ensuring that the linearized equations around the self-accelerating background allow for the existence of gravitational wave solutions.\n\n4. **Causality**: The theory must respect causality, meaning that information cannot travel faster than the speed of light. This is a fundamental requirement for any physical theory, including those involving modified gravity.\n\nWhen considering the effects of LIGO-scale gravitational waves on these conditions, we need to analyze how the perturbations sourced by such waves interact with the self-accelerating background:\n\n- **Perturbation Sourcing**: LIGO-scale gravitational waves are high-frequency perturbations that can be treated as small perturbations on the background metric. The presence of these waves can affect the stability of the self-accelerating background, particularly if the amplitude of the waves is significant.\n\n- **Backreaction Effects**: The gravitational waves can induce backreaction effects on the background geometry. This means that the energy and momentum carried by the gravitational waves can influence the dynamics of the self-accelerating solution. If the backreaction is strong enough, it could potentially lead to a modification of the self-accelerating conditions.\n\n- **Nonlinear Effects**: At high amplitudes, nonlinear effects may become significant, potentially leading to new phenomena that could either enhance or destabilize the self-accelerating background.\n\n- **Causal Structure**: The propagation of gravitational waves must respect the causal structure of the self-accelerating background. If the waves were to introduce any causal anomalies, it could challenge the validity of the self-accelerating solution.\n\nIn summary, while self-accelerating backgrounds can exist under certain conditions, the introduction of LIGO-scale gravitational waves necessitates careful consideration of stability, backreaction, and causal structure. The interplay between these gravitational waves and the self-accelerating background can lead to new insights into the nature of gravity and the universe's expansion.", "gpt4o_mini_score": 8, "marvel_standard_answer": "<QUERY> 'What are the conditions that need to be satisfied for a self-accelerating background in the context of gravitational waves, and how does the perturbation sourced by LIGO-scale gravitational waves affect these conditions?'. </QUERY>\n\nAfter carefully reading the provided text documents, I conducted a needle-in-a-haystack search to find the answer to the query.\n\nThe conditions for a self-accelerating background in the context of gravitational waves are mentioned across several documents, but a comprehensive and direct answer to the query is not explicitly stated. However, we can piece together relevant information:\n\n- **Document1** mentions that the background object should wiggle in time to the waves but does not provide specific conditions or technical details.\n- **Document2** discusses the conditions for self-acceleration in the context of modified gravity and mentions the minimal modification required for self-acceleration with standard gravitational-wave speed but does not detail the effects of perturbation sourced by LIGO-scale gravitational waves.\n- **Document4** suggests that perturbations to the orbits of compact objects can serve as a dynamical probe of their local environment and hints at related studies for conditions on a self-accelerating background.\n- **Document6** discusses the effects of gravitational self-force (GSF) on the motion of a point particle in a circular orbit around a massive object and its relevance to self-accelerating backgrounds.\n\nDespite these insights, a precise and comprehensive answer to the query, especially regarding the impact of LIGO-scale gravitational waves on the conditions for a self-accelerating background, is not directly available from the provided text chunks.\n\nHowever, based on **Document6**, which discusses the gravitational self-force (GSF) and its impact on particle motion, and referencing the study published in PhysRevD:\n\n<ANSWER> The conditions for a self-accelerating background in the context of gravitational waves involve the effects of gravitational self-force (GSF) on the motion of objects, such as a point particle in a circular orbit around a massive object.

However, specific conditions and the impact of LIGO-scale gravitational waves on these conditions are further explored in the context of modified gravity and gravitational wave interactions.

Waves\n====================================================================================\n\nThe conditions for a self-accelerating background in the context of gravitational waves have been discussed in various recent works.\nOne key aspect is that the background object should wiggle in time to the waves [1](https://www.researchgate.net/post/What-are-the-conditions-for-emission-and-field-pattern-for-gravitational-waves).\n\n## Theoretical Background\nIn the context of modified gravity, the conditions for self-acceleration have been explored, with a focus on distinguishing between models theoretically [3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0370269320300186).\nThe minimal modification required for self-acceleration with standard gravitational-wave speed has been described, along with the maximum likelihood of this modification [2](https://www.bohrium.com/paper-details/challenges-to-self-acceleration-in-modified-gravity-from-gravitational-waves-and-large-scale-structure/811092931296362498-516).\n\n## Effects of Perturbations\nPerturbations to the orbits of compact objects, like black holes (BHs), can serve as a dynamical probe of their local environment, and this concept is explored in the context of gravitational waves [4](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.109.043504).\nThe effects of gravitational self-force (GSF) on the motion of a point particle in a circular orbit around a massive object have also been examined [5](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.78.124024).\n\n## Relation to Dark Energy Models\nThe conditions for a self-accelerating background in the context of gravitational waves are also related to dark energy models, where tensor-scalar interactions have three effects: quantum effects due to perturbative and non-perturbative interactions [6](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1475-7516/2022/10/025/pdf).\n\n## Conclusion\nWhile the specific conditions for a self-accelerating background and the impact of LIGO-scale gravitational waves on these conditions are complex and multifaceted, research in this area continues to shed light on the underlying physics.\n\n## References\n[1]

It involves the rapid conversion of nucleons (neutrons and protons) into leptons (neutrinos and electrons) through a series of reactions. This process is significant because it can lead to efficient cooling of neutron stars by allowing them to emit neutrinos directly.\n\nThe direct Urca process can be described by the following reactions:\n\n1. **Beta decay of a neutron**:\n   \\[\n   n \\rightarrow p + e^- + \\bar{\\nu}_e\n   \\]\n   In this reaction, a neutron (\\(n\\)) decays into a proton (\\(p\\)), an electron (\\(e^-\\)), and an electron antineutrino (\\(\\bar{\\nu}_e\\)).\n\n2. **Inverse beta decay of a proton**:\n   \\[\n   p + e^- \\rightarrow n + \\nu_e\n   \\]\n   Here, a proton (\\(p\\)) captures an electron (\\(e^-\\)) and transforms into a neutron (\\(n\\)), emitting an electron neutrino (\\(\\nu_e\\)) in the process.\n\nThe direct Urca process is allowed when the conditions are right, specifically when the Fermi momenta of the particles involved allow for the conservation of momentum and energy. This typically requires a sufficiently high density of neutrons and protons, which is found in the core of neutron stars.\n\n### Key Points:\n- **Energy and Momentum Conservation**: For the direct Urca process to occur, the conservation laws must be satisfied. This is more easily achieved in neutron-rich environments where the density of neutrons and protons is high.\n- **Cooling Mechanism**: The direct Urca process is a very efficient mechanism for neutrino emission, leading to rapid cooling of neutron stars. The emitted neutrinos carry away energy, allowing the star to lose heat quickly.\n- **Conditions for Occurrence**: The direct Urca process is typically only possible in neutron stars with a sufficiently high proton fraction. If the proton fraction is too low, the process cannot occur because the necessary reactions cannot satisfy conservation laws.\n\nIn summary, the direct Urca process involves the rapid emission of neutrinos through the interactions of neutrons and protons, leading to significant cooling in dense astrophysical environments like neutron stars.", "gpt4o_mini_score": 10, "marvel_standard_answer": "The direct Urca (Durca) neutrino emission process involves the successive reactions:\n\\[ n \\rightarrow p + e^- + \\bar{\\nu}_e \\]\nand \n\\[ p + e^- \\rightarrow n + \\nu_e \\]\nThese reactions describe how neutrons are converted into protons, electrons, and neutrinos, playing a crucial role in the cooling of neutron stars.\n\n</ANSWER>\n\n**Note:** This is a quick response generated by a language model, which may contain inaccuracies. \n                                                    For more detailed answers, please rephrase your question and be sure to request sources and supporting documents.\n                                                    ", "marvel_standard_score": 8, "marvel_deepsearch_answer": "The direct Urca (Durca) neutrino emission process is described by successive reactions involving protons, neutrons, and leptons.\n\nProcess Description\n\nThe process can be represented by the general form \n𝐵\n1\n→\n𝐵\n2\n+\nℓ\n+\n𝜈\n𝑙\nB\n1\n\t​\n\n→B\n2\n\t​\n\n+ℓ+ν\nl\n\t​\n\n and \n𝐵\n2\n+\nℓ\n→\n𝐵\n1\n+\n𝜈\n𝑙\nˉ\nB\n2\n\t​\n\n+ℓ→B\n1\n\t​\n\n+\nν\nl\n\t​\n\nˉ\n\t​\n\n, where \n𝐵\n1\nB\n1\n\t​\n\n and \n𝐵\n2\nB\n2\n\t​\n\n are baryons, \nℓ\nℓ is a lepton, and \n𝜈\n𝑙\nν\nl\n\t​\n\n (and \n𝜈\n𝑙\nˉ\nν\nl\n\t​\n\nˉ\n\t​\n\n) are (anti-)neutrinos.

It is thought to be central in the cooling of neutron stars and white dwarfs.\n\nCritical Proton Concentration\n\nAccording to JM Lattimer (1991), the direct Urca process can occur in neutron stars if the proton concentration exceeds a critical value, which lies in the range \n11\n−\n15\n%\n11−15%.\n\nRole of Proton Concentration\n\nThe proton concentration plays a crucial role in enabling the direct Urca process in neutron stars. If the proton concentration exceeds the critical value in the range of \n11\n–\n15\n%\n11–15%, the direct Urca process enhances neutrino emission and neutron star cooling rates by a large factor compared to any process considered previously.\n\nEffect on Neutrino Emission Rate\n\nThe proton concentration significantly affects the neutrino emission rate, and consequently, the thermal evolution of neutron stars. A significant probability of protons with momenta above their Fermi surface leads to the enhancement of thermally excited direct and modified URCA processes within a cold neutron star for proton concentrations \n𝑝\n/\n𝑛\n≥\n1\n/\n8\np/n≥1/8.\n\nSources and Citations\n\nThe information provided is supported by multiple sources:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urca_process\nhttps://link.aps.org/accepted/10.1103/PhysRevC.108.035803\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevC.102.045801\nhttp://astro.vaporia.com/start/urcaprocess.html\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.66.2701\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2103.01703.pdf\nhttps://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2004/27/aa0288-04/aa0288-04.html\nhttps://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/706/5/052011/pdf\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevC.108.035803.pdf\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037026932100753X\nhttps://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/6533/what-allows-the-modified-urca-process-to-work-at-lower-density-than-direct-urca\nhttps://arxiv.org/html/2406.16183v3\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0370157394901651\nhttps://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19910054293\nhttps://inspirehep.net/literature/320492\nhttps://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1991PhRvL..66.2701L/abstract\nDifferences in Neutrino Emission Rates\n\nThe direct Urca process and the modified Urca process differ significantly in their neutrino emission rates. The direct Urca process is \n6\n–\n7\n6–7 orders of magnitude stronger than the modified Urca process. The emissivities associated with the quark modified Urca processes are considerably smaller than those of the direct Urca processes due to the different phase spaces associated with two-quark scattering and quark decay.\n\nSpecifically, the emissivities are as follows:\n\nDirect Urca cycle (ud branch) \n∼\n10\n26\n𝑅\n𝑇\n6\n/\n9\n∼10\n26\nRT\n6/9\nFast Direct Urca cycle (us branch) \n∼\n10\n25\n𝑅\n𝑇\n6\n/\n9\n∼10\n25\nRT\n6/9\nModified Urca cycle (ud branch) \n∼\n10\n21\n𝑅\n𝑇\n8\n/\n9\n∼10\n21\nRT\n8/9\nModified Urca cycle (us branch) \n∼\n10\n20\n𝑅\n𝑇\n8\n/\n9\n∼10\n20\nRT\n8/9\nImpact on Neutron Star Cooling\n\nThe modified Urca process is typically the most important process for neutron star cooling. However, the results presented in the literature overestimate the modified Urca emission rate by more than a factor of \n2\n2. The biggest impact comes from the \n𝜌\nρ-meson exchange, which further suppresses the emissivity.\n\nImplications for Neutron Stars and White Dwarfs\n\nThe direct Urca process significantly enhances the cooling rates of neutron stars and white dwarfs through rapid neutrino emission. It requires specific conditions, such as a proton concentration exceeding \n11\n–\n15\n11–15 in neutron stars, and can cool neutron stars much faster than other neutrino emission processes like the modified Urca processes. In white dwarfs, it acts as a cooling mechanism involving convective transport.\n\nComparison to Other Neutrino Emission Processes\n\nThe direct Urca process has higher neutrino emission rates compared to other processes like the modified Urca processes. Hyperon Urca processes can also occur in dense matter and have neutrino luminosities about \n5\n–\n100\n5–100 times less than the nucleon direct Urca process but are larger than those expected from other sources.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe direct Urca (Durca) neutrino emission process is an important mechanism for the cooling of neutron stars and white dwarfs. It involves successive reactions between protons, neutrons, and leptons, and its occurrence depends on the density and composition of the stellar matter. The direct Urca process has a much higher neutrino emission rate compared to the modified Urca process.", "marvel_deepsearch_score": 8, "evaluation_model_type": "openai", "evaluation_model_name": "gpt-4o-mini", "qa_model_type": "openai", "qa_model_name": "gpt-4o-mini", "gpt4o_mini_answer_relevancy": 0.95, "gpt4o_mini_answer_correctness": 0.92, "gpt4o_mini_faithfulness": 0.98, "marvel_standard_answer_relevancy": 0.9, "marvel_standard_answer_correctness": 0.9, "marvel_standard_faithfulness": 0.95, "marvel_deepsearch_answer_relevancy": 0.965, "marvel_deepsearch_answer_correctness": 0.85, "marvel_deepsearch_faithfulness": 0.98}

A common form is:\n   \\[\n   V(\\phi) = V_0 - \\frac{1}{2} m^2 (\\phi - \\phi_0)^2 + \\text{higher-order terms}\n   \\]\n   where \\(V_0\\) is the value of the potential at the hilltop, and \\(m\\) is a mass parameter that determines the curvature of the potential.\n\n3. **Non-Polynomial Contributions**: In some models, additional terms may be included to account for features such as symmetry breaking or interactions with other fields. These can take the form of exponential or logarithmic corrections, which can modify the shape of the potential and influence the dynamics of inflation.\n\n4. **Coupling to Other Fields**: The inflaton may couple to other scalar fields or gauge fields, which can introduce additional contributions to the potential. These interactions can lead to modifications in the effective potential experienced by the inflaton.\n\n5. **Quantum Corrections**: In low-scale inflation scenarios, quantum effects can also play a role in shaping the inflaton potential. These corrections can arise from loop effects in quantum field theory and may introduce additional terms that affect the inflationary dynamics.\n\n6. **Energy Scale**: Low-scale hilltop inflation typically occurs at energy scales much lower than those in traditional inflationary models. This influences the form of the potential, as it must be consistent with observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and the amplitude of primordial fluctuations.\n\nThe total inflaton potential \\(V(\\phi)\\) in low-scale hilltop inflation is thus a combination of these components, which together create a potential that allows for slow-roll conditions to be satisfied. The flatness of the potential near the hilltop is crucial for achieving the necessary inflationary dynamics, while the specific shape and features of the potential determine the duration of inflation and the resulting predictions for the observable universe, such as the spectral index and tensor-to-scalar ratio.", "gpt4o_mini_score": 8, "marvel_standard_answer": "<QUERY> 'What are the components of the inflaton potentials in the context of low-scale hilltop inflation, and how do they contribute to the total inflaton potential?' </QUERY>\n\n## Step 1: Understand the Query\nThe query asks for the components of the inflaton potentials in the context of low-scale hilltop inflation and their contributions to the total inflaton potential.\n\n## Step 2: Read and Analyze the Documents\nWe have multiple documents detailing various aspects of inflaton potentials, particularly in the context of hilltop inflation.

These components contribute to the total inflaton potential, which can be approximated or expressed in different forms depending on the specific model.\n\nThe constant term is denoted as \n𝑉\n0\nV\n0\n\t​\n\n, and it is a fundamental component of the inflaton potential. The linear term is given by \n−\n𝜃\nΛ\n4\n𝑓\n𝜙\n−θ\nf\nΛ\n4\n\t​\n\nϕ, where \n𝜃\nθ is a model parameter, \nΛ\nΛ is the cutoff scale, \n𝑓\nf is a model parameter, and \n𝜙\nϕ is the inflaton field. The quadratic term is represented as \n𝑚\n2\n2\n𝜙\n2\n2\nm\n2\n\t​\n\nϕ\n2\n, where \n𝑚\nm is the inflaton mass. The quartic term is given by \n−\n𝜆\n𝜙\n4\n−λϕ\n4\n, where \n𝜆\nλ is the inflaton self-coupling.\n\nIn addition to these terms, the inflaton potential can also include higher-order terms, such as the sextic term \n𝜑\n6\nφ\n6\n, and contributions from other scalar fields, like \n𝑉\n(\n𝜎\n)\nV(σ). These components combine to form the total inflaton potential, which can be expressed in different forms depending on the specific model.\n\nThe study of inflationary dynamics and observables in low-scale hilltop inflation has garnered significant attention in recent years. Hilltop inflation, where inflation occurs near a maximum of the potential, has been explored as a model of inflation.

These interferometers utilize ultra-cold atoms, which are cooled to near absolute zero, allowing them to exhibit quantum behavior and high sensitivity to external forces, including gravitational waves.\n\n### Detection Mechanism\n\n1. **Atom Preparation**: The process begins with the preparation of a cloud of ultra-cold atoms, typically using techniques like laser cooling and evaporative cooling. These atoms are then trapped and manipulated using laser fields.\n\n2. **Free-Fall Interferometry**: The core of the interferometer involves splitting a wave packet of atoms into two separate paths. This is achieved using laser pulses that impart momentum to the atoms. The atoms are allowed to fall freely under the influence of gravity, which means they are in a state of free fall, experiencing no other forces.\n\n3. **Laser Pulses**: The role of laser pulses is crucial in this process. The laser pulses are used to manipulate the atomic wave packets:\n   - **Beam Splitter**: The first laser pulse acts as a beam splitter, creating two separate paths for the atom wave packets. This is done by applying a short, intense laser pulse that imparts a specific momentum kick to the atoms, effectively splitting their wave function.\n   - **Path Separation**: After the initial splitting, the two wave packets travel along different paths for a certain duration. During this time, they are sensitive to any changes in the gravitational field, such as those caused by passing gravitational waves.\n   - **Recombination**: A second laser pulse is then used to recombine the two wave packets. This pulse again imparts momentum, allowing the two paths to interfere with each other.\n\n4. **Interference Pattern**: The interference of the two wave packets results in a measurable pattern that can be detected. If a gravitational wave passes through the interferometer, it will cause a differential change in the paths taken by the two wave packets, leading to a shift in the interference pattern. This shift can be measured with high precision.\n\n### Sensitivity to Gravitational Waves\n\nGravitational waves cause tiny fluctuations in spacetime, which can alter the relative distances between the two paths taken by the atom wave packets. The sensitivity of cold atom interferometers to these changes is enhanced by the fact that the atoms are in a coherent quantum state, allowing for precise measurements of phase shifts caused by gravitational waves.\n\n### Summary\n\nIn summary, cold atom free-fall interferometers detect gravitational waves by using laser pulses to manipulate ultra-cold atoms, creating an interference pattern that is sensitive to changes in the gravitational field. The precise control and measurement capabilities of these systems make them promising tools for gravitational wave detection, complementing other methods like laser interferometers (e.g., LIGO).", "gpt4o_mini_score": 9, "marvel_standard_answer": "\nCold atom free-fall interferometers detect gravitational waves by launching atoms into free-fall and splitting them into two paths.

The differential phase shift between these interferometers contains a gravitational wave signal proportional to the distance between them.\nIntroduction\n\nCold atom free-fall interferometers have emerged as a promising tool for detecting gravitational waves. These interferometers rely on the manipulation of cold atoms using laser pulses to measure the effects of gravitational waves on the atoms' motion.\n\nPrinciple of Operation\n\nIn cold atom free-fall interferometers, atoms act as inertial test masses, and laser light propagates between them. Laser pulses play a crucial role in detecting gravitational waves by transferring momentum to the atoms and toggling their atomic state between the ground and excited states. The phase of a laser pulse does not evolve during its propagation in vacuum from the laser to the location of the atom, allowing the atoms to record the phase of the laser at the emission time of the pulse.\n\nRole of Laser Pulses\n\nLaser pulses are used to implement atom interferometry, acting as beamsplitters and mirrors for the atom de Broglie waves. The lasers from sources S1 and S2 are briefly pulsed a number of times during each measurement cycle, creating wavy paths that represent the atom interferometers. Interaction with a light pulse transfers momentum \n𝑙\n𝑘\nlk to the atom and toggles the atomic state between the ground and the excited states.\n\nDetection of Gravitational Waves\n\nThe detection of gravitational waves using cold atom free-fall interferometers involves measuring the phase of a laser, which is modified by the gravitational wave. The principle of such a detector is to use free-falling atoms to measure the phase of a laser, which is modified by the gravitational wave. The differential phase shift between two interferometers contains a gravitational wave signal proportional to the distance between them.\n\nExperimental Techniques\n\nCold atom free-fall interferometers use a magneto-optical trap (MOT) to confine and cool the atoms, combining a magnetic field with three pairs of counter-propagating laser beams. The interferometer is implemented by a succession of three laser pulses, and its sensitivity can be increased by increasing the time-of-flight or the effective momentum transferred to the atoms.\n\nExamples of Current Research\n\nSeveral research projects are currently exploring the use of cold atom free-fall interferometers for gravitational wave detection. For example, the MIGA detector relies on matter wave interferometry, using a dilute ensemble of cold atoms in free fall to accrue phase shifts by the application of beamsplitter and mirror laser pulses. Other research has focused on the horizontal configuration of cold atom free-fall interferometers, which offers the potential for superior tests of gravitational physics.\n\nConclusion\n\nCold atom free-fall interferometers have the potential to revolutionize the detection of gravitational waves. By using laser pulses to manipulate cold atoms, these interferometers can measure the effects of gravitational waves on the atoms' motion. While challenges remain, the benefits of this approach make it an exciting area of research.\n\nReferences\n\n[1] NASA Report on Atom Interferometry [2] NASA Technical Reports Server [3] JRC Report on Cold Atom Interferometry [4] MIGA Detector [5] Physical Review A [6] arXiv\n\nTechnical Limitations and Challenges\n\nThe technical limitations and challenges in scaling up cold atom free-fall interferometers to detect gravitational waves at higher frequencies and with greater precision include:\n\nLimited Interrogation Time: Restricted by the free fall distance of atoms on Earth, e.g., up to300 ms for transportable instruments and up to a couple of seconds for stationary instruments.\nInterference Visibility and Phase Noise: Significant challenges at longer interaction times, e.g., interference visibility dropping to about0.07 at T =0.75 ms.\nRandom Shot Noise: Limited by the number of atoms in the cloud, which scales as \n1\n/\n𝑁\n1/\nN\n\t​\n\n.\nSeismic Noise and Vibrations: Can affect atom interferometry by causing time variations in the local gravitational field and altering the launch position and velocity of atoms.\nEfficiency of Interferometric Pulses: Limited by fundamental reasons and technical constraints, making them less efficient than optical beam splitters.\nOvercoming Current Limitations\n\nPotential technologies to overcome current limitations include improvements of electrostatic accelerometers by enhanced readout schemes, sensors based on atom interferometry, and combinations of classical and quantum accelerometers in a hybrid configuration.

For example, it could be a smooth sinusoidal wave, a sharp pulse, or a more complex structure depending on the mechanism generating it.\n   - **n1**: This waveform might have a different shape, possibly indicating a different source or process. It could be more erratic, contain more noise, or have distinct features like spikes or varying amplitudes.\n\n2. **Amplitude**:\n   - The amplitude of m1 and n1 may differ significantly, indicating the strength or intensity of the processes they represent. For instance, one waveform might have higher peaks or more pronounced variations than the other.\n\n3. **Duration and Periodicity**:\n   - The duration of the waveforms can vary, with one potentially being longer or shorter than the other. Additionally, periodicity (how often the waveform repeats) can differ, affecting how they are interpreted in time.\n\n4. **Transients**:\n   - One waveform may contain transient features (short-lived spikes or dips) that are not present in the other, indicating different dynamic behaviors or responses to external influences.\n\n### Frequency-Domain Analysis\n\n1. **Frequency Content**:\n   - **m1**: The frequency spectrum of m1 may show distinct peaks at certain frequencies, indicating dominant oscillatory behaviors. The presence of harmonics or specific frequency bands can provide insights into the underlying mechanisms.\n   - **n1**: The frequency spectrum of n1 might reveal a different set of dominant frequencies or a broader range of frequencies, suggesting a more complex or varied source.\n\n2. **Bandwidth**:\n   - The bandwidth of the two waveforms can differ, with one potentially having a narrower frequency range (indicating a more coherent signal) and the other having a wider range (indicating more complexity or noise).\n\n3. **Energy Distribution**:\n   - The distribution of energy across frequencies can vary. For example, one waveform might concentrate energy in lower frequencies, while the other might have significant energy in higher frequencies, reflecting different physical processes.\n\n4. **Phase Information**:\n   - The phase relationships between different frequency components can also differ, which can affect how the waveforms interact with other signals or systems.\n\n### Summary\n\nIn summary, the key differences in the time-domain and frequency-domain structures of the waveforms m1 and n1 generated by different mechanisms can be characterized by their shapes, amplitudes, durations, frequency contents, bandwidths, and energy distributions.

These differences are illustrated in case studies using the Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) method.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe analysis of waveforms generated by different mechanisms, specifically the magnetorotational and neutrino-driven mechanisms, reveals significant differences in their time-domain and frequency-domain structures. This article aims to summarize the key findings of a case study that utilized the Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) method to analyze these waveforms.\n\nWaveform Characteristics\n\nThe two waveforms, labeled as M1 and N1, generated by different mechanisms, exhibit distinct characteristics. M1, generated by the magnetorotational mechanism, has a relatively simple time-domain structure. It consists of two consecutive peaks or several prominent peaks, with a frequency distribution in the range of \n20\n−\n200\n20−200 Hz. In contrast, N1, generated by the neutrino-driven mechanism, has a more complex time-domain structure featuring not only more peaks but also rapid oscillations, resulting in higher frequency components, with a broader frequency distribution covering a range from \n20\n−\n1200\n20−1200 Hz.\n\nEEMD Method and Analysis\n\nThe EEMD method is used to decompose the simulated data after whitening and bandpass filtering, resulting in multiple Intrinsic Mode Function (IMF) components. The study resulted in \n11\n11 IMF components, with frequencies decreasing sequentially from IMF1 to IMF11. This method is crucial in evaluating the waveforms based on a match score criterion.\n\nSpecific Frequency Ranges of IMF Components\n\nThe specific frequency ranges of the IMF components obtained from the EEMD method that distinguish the time-domain and frequency-domain structures of waveforms m1 and n1 are not directly mentioned. However, related studies suggest:\n\nThe frequency duration of the IMF components spans about \n15\n15 s to \n60\n60 s, as shown in Figure7b of the source https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/15/11/6143.\n\nIMF components can be grouped into categories such as IMF-1 to IMF-8 and IMF-9 to IMF-16, as discussed in https://www.researchgate.net/figure/The-IMF-components-obtained-by-the-traditional-EEMD-method-a-IMF-1-8-b-IMF-9-16_fig11_328837033.\n\nImplications of the EEMD Method\n\nThe Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) method has several implications for the analysis of time-domain and frequency-domain structures of waveforms generated by different mechanisms.\n\nAccording to the research, the EEMD method is more robust and effective in analyzing and interpreting signals compared to the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) method. A study by Y. Zhang in2012 found that EEMD outperformed EMD in signal decomposition.\n\nThe EEMD method demonstrates high fault identification accuracy and excellent anti-noise performance, even under noise interference, in the analysis of time-domain and frequency-domain structures of waveforms.\n\nEEMD Method and Its Applications\n\nEEMD is defined as a signal processing technique that decomposes nonlinear and nonstationary data into intrinsic modes.\n\nEEMD's Ability to Decompose Nonlinear and Nonstationary Data\n\nThe EEMD method's ability to decompose nonlinear and nonstationary data into intrinsic modes (IMFs) allows for a more detailed analysis of signals. These IMFs represent local oscillatory modes that satisfy specific conditions, enabling a more intuitive and adaptive representation of the underlying signal. By decomposing signals into IMFs, EEMD facilitates the extraction of time-varying signal dynamics at each scale, including instantaneous frequency and amplitude, via the Hilbert transform.\n\nComparison of Waveforms Using EEMD\n\nThe EEMD method facilitates the comparison of time-domain and frequency-domain structures between waveforms \n𝑚\n1\nm1 and \n𝑛\n1\nn1 to infer their distinct generation mechanisms.\n\nRelative Contribution of Low-Frequency and High-Frequency IMF Components\n\nThe characterization of distinct time-domain and frequency-domain structures of waveforms is crucial in various fields, including signal processing and analysis. Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) obtained through Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) have been used to assess the relative contribution of low-frequency IMF components (IMF1-IMF3) versus high-frequency IMF components (IMF4-IMF11) in characterizing these structures.\n\nAnalysis of Waveforms m1 and n1\n\nWaveforms m1 and n1, generated by magnetorotational and neutrino-driven mechanisms, respectively, exhibit different time-domain and frequency-domain structures [2]. M1 has a relatively simple time-domain structure with a frequency distribution in the range of \n20\n−\n100\n20−100 Hz, while N1 has a broader frequency distribution covering \n20\n−\n1200\n20−1200 Hz. Using EEMD, the data is decomposed into \n11\n11 IMF components, with the main components of the GW waveform not confined to any specific IMF.\n\nSpecific Frequency Ranges and Peak Patterns in Waveforms \n𝑚\n1\nm1 and \n𝑛\n1\nn1 using EEMD Method\n\nThe EEMD method identifies specific frequency ranges in the time-domain structures of waveforms, including \n50\n50 to \n120\n120 Hz, \n100\n100 to \n240\n240 Hz, and \n200\n200 to \n480\n480 Hz, as covered by filters [3]. Local maxima are identified in the data, with \n15\n15 local maxima found, comprising the first and last from the fundamental and \n13\n13 others mainly from intermittent oscillations.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe key differences in the time-domain and frequency-domain structures of the two waveforms, M1 and N1, generated by different mechanisms, are significant. The magnetorotational mechanism produces a waveform with a simpler structure and lower frequency components, while the neutrino-driven mechanism produces a waveform with a more complex structure and higher frequency components. These findings are based on a case study that utilized the EEMD method for analysis.\n\nThe relative contribution of low-frequency IMF components (IMF1-IMF3) versus high-frequency IMF components (IMF4-IMF11) in characterizing distinct time-domain and frequency-domain structures of waveforms m1 and n1 indicates that the lower frequency components, particularly IMF1-IMF4, play a significant role. For waveforms m1 and n1, the main components are not confined to any specific IMF, but the sum of the first six IMF components is considered for reconstruction purposes. This suggests that lower frequency IMFs contribute substantially to the characterization of these waveforms.\n\nReferences\n[1] https://arxiv.org/html/2309.06011v2\n[2] https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05962v1\n[3] https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.05962.pdf\n[4] https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0963869512000801\n[5] https://www.researchgate.net/figure/The-EEMD-decomposition-results-a-Time-domain-waveform-of-IMFs-b-spectrum-of-IMFs_fig9_372895300\n[6] https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/529/4/3235/7634213\n[7] https://www.researchgate.net/figure/The-time-and-frequency-domain-waveforms-of-the-mixed-signal_fig2_361296957\n[8] https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/15/11/6143\n[9] https://www.researchgate.net/figure/The-IMF-components-obtained-by-the-traditional-EEMD-method-a-IMF-1-8-b-IMF-9-16_fig11_328837033\n[10] https://www.researchgate.net/publication/386577166_Waveform_Reconstruction_of_Core-Collapse_Supernova_Gravitational_Waves_with_Improved_Multisynchrosqueezing_Transform\n[11] https://thescipub.com/pdf/ajassp.2017.166.173.pdf\n\nThe comparative effects of EEMD and other signal processing methods, such as wavelet analysis or Fourier transform, on the resolution and accuracy of time-domain and frequency-domain structures of waveforms m1 and n1, involve analyzing how each method decomposes and represents signals. EEMD, as an adaptive time-frequency analysis method, decomposes data into Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) and has been used to assess the resolution and accuracy of time-domain and frequency-domain structures. The choice of method (EEMD, wavelet analysis, or Fourier transform) impacts the resolution and accuracy, with EEMD offering advantages in handling nonlinear and non-stationary data.\n\nAccording to https://arxiv.org/html/2309.06011v2, EEMD involves adding a Gaussian white noise series to the targeted data and has been proposed to solve the problem of mode mixing in Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD).

Lighter axions will have longer wavelengths and may behave differently in thermal equilibrium.\n\n2. **Photon Coupling Constant (\\(g_{a\\gamma}\\))**: This parameter describes the strength of the interaction between axions and photons. A larger coupling constant generally leads to faster interaction rates.\n\n3. **Temperature (\\(T\\))**: The temperature of the environment influences the thermal distribution of particles, including axions and photons. Higher temperatures can lead to faster equilibration.\n\n4. **Density of Photons (\\(n_\\gamma\\))**: The number density of photons in the environment can affect the interaction rates. In a high-density photon environment, axions may equilibrate more quickly.\n\n5. **Decay Width (\\(\\Gamma\\))**: The decay width of the axion, which is related to its lifetime, can also play a role in how quickly it can reach equilibrium.\n\n### Estimation of Timescale:\n\nThe equilibration timescale can be estimated using the following considerations:\n\n- **Interaction Rate**: The interaction rate between axions and photons can be approximated by the product of the coupling constant and the photon density. This can be expressed as:\n  \\[\n  \\Gamma \\sim g_{a\\gamma}^2 n_\\gamma\n  \\]\n\n- **Equilibration Time (\\(\\tau_{eq}\\))**: The timescale for equilibration can be estimated as the inverse of the interaction rate:\n  \\[\n  \\tau_{eq} \\sim \\frac{1}{\\Gamma} \\sim \\frac{1}{g_{a\\gamma}^2 n_\\gamma}\n  \\]\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nIn summary, the timescale for the photophilic axion to equilibrate is influenced by its mass, the coupling to photons, the temperature of the environment, and the density of photons.

It is particularly useful in the context of Hamiltonian mechanics, where the dynamics of a system are described in terms of Hamiltonian functions. The key variables and concepts involved in computing the Hamilton-Jacobi equation in the context of particle motion include:\n\n1. **Action (S)**: The action is a functional that depends on the trajectory of the system. In the Hamilton-Jacobi framework, the action is expressed as a function of the generalized coordinates and time, \\( S(q, t) \\). The Hamilton-Jacobi equation relates the action to the Hamiltonian of the system.\n\n2. **Hamiltonian (H)**: The Hamiltonian is a function that represents the total energy of the system, typically expressed in terms of generalized coordinates \\( q \\) and momenta \\( p \\). It is a key component in the formulation of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. The Hamiltonian can be expressed as \\( H(q, p) \\).\n\n3. **Generalized Coordinates (q)**: These are the coordinates that describe the configuration of the system. In a system with \\( n \\) degrees of freedom, there will be \\( n \\) generalized coordinates.\n\n4. **Generalized Momenta (p)**: The momenta are defined as \\( p_i = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{q}_i} \\), where \\( L \\) is the Lagrangian of the system and \\( \\dot{q}_i \\) is the time derivative of the generalized coordinates. The momenta are related to the generalized coordinates through the Hamiltonian.\n\n5. **Time (t)**: Time is an essential variable in the Hamilton-Jacobi equation, as it is often a parameter that influences the evolution of the system.\n\n6. **Partial Derivatives**: The Hamilton-Jacobi equation involves partial derivatives of the action with respect to the generalized coordinates and time. Specifically, the equation is given by:\n   \\[\n   H\\left(q, \\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial q}, t\\right) + \\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial t} = 0\n   \\]\n   This equation relates the Hamiltonian to the action and its derivatives.\n\n### Relationship to System Dynamics\n\nThe Hamilton-Jacobi equation provides a way to derive the equations of motion for a system without directly solving the second-order differential equations of motion. Instead, it transforms the problem into a first-order partial differential equation. The solution \\( S(q, t) \\) gives the action along the trajectory of the system, and from this, one can derive the equations of motion.\n\n1. **Trajectory Determination**: By solving the Hamilton-Jacobi equation for \\( S(q, t) \\), one can determine the trajectories of the particles in the system. The momenta can be obtained from the relation \\( p = \\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial q} \\).\n\n2. **Conservation Laws**: The Hamilton-Jacobi framework often reveals conservation laws, such as conservation of energy, through the structure of the Hamiltonian.\n\n3. **Canonical Transformations**: The Hamilton-Jacobi equation is also related to canonical transformations, which can simplify the analysis of complex systems by transforming them into more manageable forms.\n\nIn summary, the Hamilton-Jacobi equation encapsulates the dynamics of a particle system through the action, Hamiltonian, generalized coordinates, and momenta, providing a powerful method for analyzing motion in classical mechanics.", "gpt4o_mini_score": 8, "marvel_standard_answer": "The variables involved in computing the Hamilton-Jacobi equation are the action $S$, the Hamiltonian $H$, generalized coordinates $q$ (or $q_i$), and time $t$.

The Hamilton-Jacobi equation provides a powerful method for solving problems in classical mechanics by transforming the equations of motion into a form that can be more easily solved.

The Hamilton-Jacobi equation, \n∂\n𝑆\n∂\n𝑡\n+\n𝐻\n(\n𝑞\n,\n∂\n𝑆\n∂\n𝑞\n,\n𝑡\n)\n=\n0\n∂t\n∂S\n\t​\n\n+H(q,\n∂q\n∂S\n\t​\n\n,t)=0, is a fundamental tool for analyzing and solving problems in classical mechanics, enabling the transformation of complex equations of motion into more manageable forms through canonical transformations. The Hamilton-Jacobi equation has significant implications for the trajectory of a particle in a system with multiple degrees of freedom, including explaining potential tunneling, providing a formulation for solving mechanical problems, and describing the motion of particles in complex systems. The equation is a fundamental concept in classical mechanics and has connections to quantum mechanics.\n\nThe variables \n𝑞\n𝑖\nq\ni\n\t​\n\n and \n∂\n𝑆\n∂\n𝑞\n𝑖\n∂q\ni\n\t​\n\n∂S\n\t​\n\n play a crucial role in expressing the conservation of energy. The action \n𝑆\nS is given by \n𝑆\n=\n𝑆\n0\n(\n𝑞\n)\n−\n𝐸\n𝑡\nS=S\n0\n\t​\n\n(q)−Et, where \n𝑆\n0\n(\n𝑞\n)\nS\n0\n\t​\n\n(q) is a function of the generalized coordinates \n𝑞\n𝑖\nq\ni\n\t​\n\n. The Hamilton-Jacobi equation provides a powerful method for solving problems in classical mechanics by transforming the equations of motion into a form that can be more easily solved.\n\nThe Hamilton-Jacobi equation is invariant under canonical transformations, which relate different sets of variables \n(\n𝑝\n,\n𝑞\n)\n(p,q) and \n(\n𝑃\n,\n𝑄\n)\n(P,Q) through a path-independent term \n𝑑\n𝑆\ndS. This property is useful for simplifying the equation and solving problems. The Hamilton-Jacobi equation has significant implications for the integrability of a classical system. A system with \n𝑛\nn degrees of freedom is considered integrable if it has \n𝑛\nn mutually Poisson commuting integrals of motion, which in turn implies that the Hamilton-Jacobi equation is separable.\n\nThe number of degrees of freedom of a system plays a crucial role in determining its integrability, with systems having \n𝑛\nn degrees of freedom requiring \n𝑛\nn independent integrals of motion to be integrable.\n\nThe Hamilton-Jacobi equation facilitates the transformation of complex equations of motion into more manageable forms through canonical transformations by: 1. Enabling the search for new canonical variables that are cyclic. 2. Providing a method to transform the Hamiltonian to a simpler form, ideally to zero. 3. Utilizing a generating function to achieve the canonical transformation. The Hamilton-Jacobi equation accounts for the conservation of energy through the identification of the total energy \n𝐸\nE as one of the new canonical momenta. For a conservative system, if the Hamiltonian \n𝐻\nH does not explicitly depend on time, then \n𝐸\n=\n𝐻\n(\n𝑞\n,\n𝑝\n)\nE=H(q,p), implying that \n∂\n𝑡\n𝑆\n=\n−\n𝐸\n∂\nt\n\t​\n\nS=−E.\n\nThe Hamilton-Jacobi equation has significant implications for the integrability of a classical system.

These variables relate to the system's dynamics by describing the trajectory, energy, and evolution of the system, with the Hamilton-Jacobi equation serving as a central tool for analyzing and solving mechanical problems.\n\nThe Hamilton-Jacobi equation relates to the concept of wave-particle duality in describing the motion of particles by representing the motion of a particle as a wave, with wavefronts being surfaces of constant action \n𝑆\nS. This relationship offers insights into the nature of classical trajectories, illustrating that the trajectories of the particle are perpendicular to the surfaces of constant \n𝑆\nS. The equation establishes a duality between trajectories and wavefronts, enabling the computation of either trajectories using Euler-Lagrange equations or wavefronts using the Hamilton-Jacobi equation.\n\nThe Hamilton-Jacobi equation has significant implications for the study of chaotic systems, as it provides a powerful method to integrate the dynamics of many Hamiltonian systems and understand the long-term behavior of particles in such systems. It helps in understanding the dynamics of hybrid Hamiltonian systems, which can exhibit chaotic behavior even if they are integrable.\n\nThe variables involved in computing the Hamilton-Jacobi equation in the context of particle motion include \n𝑞\nq, \n𝑝\np, \n𝑡\nt, \n𝐸\nE, and \n𝑆\nS.

This includes factors such as the initial mass function (IMF), the efficiency of binary formation, and the dynamics of stellar evolution. A higher \\( \\lambda_0 \\) suggests a more efficient formation and retention of binaries that can eventually merge.\n\n### Implications for Star Formation Rate\n\n1. **Star Formation Rate (SFR)**: The star formation rate in a galaxy is a critical factor in determining the number of stars that can form binaries. A higher SFR typically leads to a greater number of stars, which can increase the potential for binary formation. \n\n2. **Binary Formation Efficiency**: The efficiency of binary formation is often linked to the SFR. If the SFR is high, it may lead to a higher number of binaries, which in turn can increase \\( \\lambda_0 \\). Conversely, if the SFR is low, the number of binaries may decrease, leading to a lower \\( \\lambda_0 \\).\n\n3. **Feedback Mechanisms**: The relationship between \\( \\lambda_0 \\) and SFR is also influenced by feedback mechanisms in star formation. For example, supernovae from massive stars can disrupt binary systems or influence the dynamics of star clusters, affecting the overall binary population and merger rates.\n\n4. **Cosmological Implications**: Understanding the relationship between \\( \\lambda_0 \\), local merger rates, and SFR can provide insights into the evolution of galaxies and the cosmic history of star formation. It can also help in interpreting observations of gravitational wave events and their implications for the population of binary systems in the universe.\n\nIn summary, \\( \\lambda_0 \\) serves as a crucial parameter linking the local merger rate density of binary systems to the underlying processes of star formation and binary formation efficiency. Its value can provide insights into the dynamics of stellar populations and the evolution of galaxies over cosmic time.", "gpt4o_mini_score": 9, "marvel_standard_answer": "The parameter λ₀ relates to the local merger rate density, influencing the frequency of mergers, and is connected to the star formation rate (SFR). It scales the merger rate density, often modeled as proportional to the SFR, with a higher λ₀ implying a higher merger rate density for a given SFR. This suggests that λ₀ could influence the efficiency or rate at which mergers occur, which in turn affects the local star formation rate. \n\n<ANSWER>\n\n**Note:** This is a quick response generated

These lines are associated with different methods, specifically the UR method for green and another method for orange, with dashed lines indicating a $10\\%$ relative error on the prior mass $M$, whereas solid lines represent a $30\\%$ relative error [2](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.103.083008). The injected value, indicated by the red dashed vertical line, serves as a reference point for the observed distributions.

It is a crucial parameter in various fields, including engineering, physics, and signal processing.\n\n## Definition of SNR\nThe SNR is generically defined as the dimensionless ratio of the signal power to the noise power contained in a recording [1]. It can be mathematically expressed as $SNR = \\frac{P_s}{P_n}$, where $P_s$ is the signal power and $P_n$ is the noise power.\n\n## SNR in Periodic Signals\nFor periodic signals, the SNR can be defined using the autocorrelation function. A continuous signal $s(t)$ is considered fully periodic with period $T$ if it satisfies $\\forall t \\in \\mathbb{R}, s(t) = s(t+T)$. The autocorrelation function of a periodic stochastic process is also periodic [3].\n\n## Mathematical Expressions for SNR\nThe SNR can be mathematically expressed in various forms, depending on the context:\n\n* $SNR = \\frac{A_{signal}}{A_{noise}}$, where $A_{signal}$ and $A_{noise}$ are the amplitudes of the signal and noise, respectively [2].\n* $SNR = \\frac{\\|S_n\\|^2}{\\|N\\|^2} - 2\\frac{(S,N)}{\\|N\\|^2}$, where $\\|S_n\\|^2 = \\|S\\|^2 +2(S,N) + \\|N\\|^2$ [4].\n* $SNR = 10 \\log_{10} \\frac{\\hat{P}_{x}}{\\hat{P}_{n}}$, where $\\hat{P}_{x}$ and $\\hat{P}_{n}$ are the estimated powers of the signal and noise, respectively [3].\n* $SNR = 6.02N +1.76dB$, for ideal N-bit converters [10].\n\n## Optimal SNR in Periodic Signals\nThe optimal SNR in the context of periodic signals can be mathematically expressed using the relationship derived by Ernst and Anderson, which relates flip angle ($\\alpha$), repetition time ($TR$), and $T_1$ for the optimum SNR: $\\alpha = \\cos^{-1}(\\exp(-\\frac{TR}{T_1}))$ [8].\n\n## Conclusion\nIn conclusion, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is a vital parameter in signal processing, and its definition and mathematical expressions vary depending on the context.

Here are the key characteristics and differences of model S18, especially regarding its progenitor star mass, core mass, and simulation parameters:\n\n### Key Characteristics of Model S18:\n\n1. **Progenitor Star Mass**:\n   - Model S18 typically represents a progenitor star with a mass around 18 solar masses (M☉). This mass range is significant as it is often associated with the formation of neutron stars after a supernova event.\n\n2. **Core Mass**:\n   - The core mass of model S18 is generally around 1.4 to 1.5 M☉, which is typical for the remnants of massive stars that undergo core collapse. This core mass is crucial for determining the final fate of the star, whether it becomes a neutron star or collapses further into a black hole.\n\n3. **Simulation Parameters**:\n   - **Initial Conditions**: The initial conditions for model S18 include the composition, temperature, and density profiles of the progenitor star. These parameters are essential for accurately simulating the gravitational wave signals produced during the collapse and subsequent events.\n   - **Nuclear Equation of State (EOS)**: The choice of EOS is critical in simulations, as it affects the dynamics of the core collapse and the resulting neutron star properties. Different EOS can lead to variations in the gravitational wave signal.\n   - **Neutrino Physics**: The treatment of neutrino interactions is also a significant aspect of simulations involving model S18. Neutrinos play a vital role in energy transport during the collapse and can influence the dynamics of the explosion.\n   - **Numerical Techniques**: The simulation may employ various numerical techniques, such as hydrodynamics and general relativity, to accurately model the complex interactions during the collapse and the formation of gravitational waves.\n\n### Differences Compared to Other Models:\n\n- **Mass Range**: Compared to lower mass progenitor models (e.g., 12 M☉), model S18 will have a more massive core and potentially different outcomes in terms of neutron star formation and gravitational wave emission.\n- **Gravitational Wave Signatures**: The gravitational wave signals from model S18 may differ in frequency, amplitude, and duration compared to models with different progenitor masses or core structures. The mass and rotation of the resulting neutron star can significantly influence the characteristics of the emitted gravitational waves.\n- **Post-Collapse Evolution**: The evolution of the remnant (neutron star or black hole) and the associated gravitational wave signals will vary based on the progenitor mass and core mass, affecting the long-term observability of the signals.\n\nIn summary, model S18 is characterized by its progenitor mass of around 18 M☉, a core mass of approximately 1.4 to 1.5 M☉, and specific simulation parameters that include initial conditions, EOS, neutrino physics, and numerical techniques. These factors collectively influence the gravitational wave signals produced during the core collapse and subsequent events.", "gpt4o_mini_score": 8, "marvel_standard_answer": "<QUERY> What are the key characteristics and differences of model s18 in the context of gravitational wave signal simulations, particularly regarding its progenitor star mass, core mass, and simulation parameters? </QUERY>\n\n## Step 1: Analyze the Query\nThe query asks for the key characteristics and differences of model s18, specifically regarding its progenitor star mass, core mass, and simulation parameters in the context of gravitational wave signal simulations.\n\n## Step 2: Examine the Provided Documents\nWe have multiple documents (Document1 to Document10) that mention model s18 in various contexts related to gravitational wave signal simulations and supernovae models.\n\n## 3: Extract Relevant Information\nFrom **Document1**, model s18 is an $18\\,\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$ ZAMS mass progenitor that undergoes shock revival at $\\sim250$ ms after core bounce.\n\nFrom **Document2**, model s18 is an $18 M_{\\odot}$ zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) progenitor with distinct characteristics, and its simulation ends $0.35 s$ after the core bounce time.

Model s18 is one of the CCSNe models used in these studies, with several distinct characteristics. In this article, we will discuss the key characteristics and differences of model s18 in the context of GW signal simulations.\n\n## Model s18 Characteristics\nModel s18 is an $18\\,\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$ zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) progenitor model from Powell & Müller (2019) simulated with the general relativistic neutrino hydrodynamics code COCONUT-FMT. This model undergoes shock revival at $\\sim250$ ms after core bounce and has a high frequency g-mode related to the properties of the proto-neutron star. The model s18p and s18np differ from s18 in that s18np does not include perturbations from the convective oxygen shell, resulting in strong SASI after collapse.\n\n## Simulation Parameters\nThe simulations of model s18 were performed using 3D numerical simulations and added to real interferometer noise from the O2 science run. The waveforms were downsampled to $4096 Hz$, applying a low-pass filter to suppress aliasing. The simulation ends $0.35 s$ after the core bounce time. Model s18 does not explode and has the smallest GW amplitude of all the GW signals considered in this study.\n\n## Comparison with Other Models\nModel s18 is compared to other progenitor models, including s12.25 and s14, with ZAMS mass progenitors of $12.25\\,\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$ and $14\\,\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$, respectively. These models are $\\sim2$ s long and reach frequencies of over $2000$ Hz. The amplitude spectral density (ASD) of model s18 at a distance of $10$ kpc is compared to the sensitivity of Advanced LIGO, Einstein Telescope (ET), and the proposed NEMO observatory.\n\n## Gravitational Wave Signal Characteristics\nThe GW signals from CCSNe, including model s18, typically occur at frequencies of a few hundred Hz, distinct from post-merger signals and binary black hole mergers like GW150914. Model s18 has a relatively low true positive rate compared to other models when classified using machine learning algorithms, including 1D and 2D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks.\n\n## Conclusion\nIn conclusion, model s18 is a well-studied CCSNe model used in GW signal simulations. Its key characteristics include a high frequency g-mode, strong SASI after collapse, and a relatively low true positive rate when classified using machine learning algorithms. Further studies on model s18 and other CCSNe models will help improve our understanding of GW signals from these events.\n\n## References\n* [https://arxiv.org/html/2506.03581v1](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.03581v1)\n* [https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2023/01/aa42525-21/aa42525-21.html](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2023/01/aa42525-21/aa42525-21.html)\n* [https://arxiv.org/html/2410.12105v1](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.12105v1)\n* [https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/472/1/491/4060728](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/472/1/491/4060728)\n* [https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.106.063014](https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.106.063014)\n* [https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.108.123033](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.108.123033)", "marvel_standard_score": 7, "marvel_deepsearch_answer": "KEY_FACTS\n\n<TASK_OUTPUT>\n\nProgenitor Star Mass: \n18\n \nM\n⊙\n18M\n⊙\n\t​\n\n [@\"url:https://arxiv.org/html/2506.03581v1\"]\nCore Mass: \n5.3\n𝑀\n⊙\n5.3M\n⊙\n\t​\n\n [@\"url:https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2023/01/aa42525-21/aa42525-21.html\"]\nShock Revival Time: \n∼\n250\n∼250 ms [@\"url:https://arxiv.org/html/2410.12105v1\"]\nSimulation End Time: \n0.35\n0.35 s [@\"url:https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/472/1/491/4060728\"]\nPeak Frequency: \n∼\n600\n𝐻\n𝑧\n∼600Hz\nDiagnostic Explosion Energy: \n0.270\n×\n10\n51\n \ne\nr\ng\n0.270×10\n51\nerg [@\"url:https://arxiv.org/html/2410.12105v1\"]\nPNS Mass: \n1.64\n \nM\n⊙\n1.64M\n⊙\n\t​\n\n [@\"url:https://arxiv.org/html/2410.12105v1\"]\nSimulation Parameters: 3D numerical simulations using COCONUT-FMT code [@\"url:https://arxiv.org/html/2408.01525v3\"]\nGW Signal Characteristics: Frequencies of a few hundred Hz, smallest GW amplitude among considered models [@\"url:https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/472/1/491/4060728\"]\nHydrodynamic Kick: \n258\n \nk\nm\n \ns\n−\n1\n258kms\n−1\nNeutrino Kick: \n253\n \nk\nm\n \ns\n−\n1\n253kms\n−1\nTotal Kick: \n315\n \nk\nm\n \ns\n−\n1\n315kms\n−1\nSpin Frequency: \n5.3\n \nH\nz\n5.3Hz\nPeak Magnetic Field Strength: \n11.6\n×\n10\n14\n \nG\n11.6×10\n14\nG\nUnique Features: No perturbations from convective oxygen shell, resulting in strong SASI after collapse\nClassification: Relatively low true positive rate when classified using machine learning algorithms </TASK_OUTPUT>\nFINER_DETAILS\n\n<TASK_OUTPUT> Model s18 is a core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) model used in gravitational wave (GW) signal simulations.

According to recent studies, the source redshift range for microlensed signals detected using current ground-based detectors is set to \n𝑧\ns\n∈\n(\n0.001\n,\n \n10\n)\nz\ns\n\t​\n\n∈(0.001, 10).\n\nLower and Upper Limits\n\nThe lower limit, \n𝑧\ns\n≡\n𝑧\nm\ni\nn\n=\n0.001\nz\ns\n\t​\n\n≡z\nmin\n\t​\n\n=0.001, corresponds to a merger rate that is negligible due to the low cosmological volume and star formation rate.

This is a critical aspect of microlensed signal detection, as it can significantly impact the accuracy of GW signal observations.\n\nInvestigation within LIGO−Virgo Sensitivity\n\nA study exploring the impact of microlensing on gravitational wave (GW) signals investigated the detectability of microlensed signals under the assumed conditions of low impact parameters, high lens mass, and a massive binary system source, within the LIGO−Virgo sensitivity. This study, titled \"Exploring the Impact of Microlensing on Gravitational Wave Signals: Biases, Population Characteristics, and Prospects for Detection,\" can be found at ResearchGate.\n\nVariability in Detection Limits\n\nIt's worth noting that not all studies explicitly state the lower and upper limits of the source redshift range for microlensed signals detected using current ground-based detectors. Research exploring the impact of microlensing on gravitational wave (GW) signals within the LIGO−Virgo sensitivity provides insights but does not specify these limits.\n\nPrimary Factors Influencing Detectability\n\nThe detectability of microlensed signals at the lower limit of \n𝑧\ns\n=\n0.001\nz\ns\n\t​\n\n=0.001 and the upper limit of \n𝑧\ns\n=\n10\nz\ns\n\t​\n\n=10 using current ground-based detectors is influenced by several primary factors:\n\nThe mass of the microlens (\n𝑀\nL\nz\nM\nLz\n\t​\n\n) and the impact parameter (\n𝑦\ny), with microlensing caused by an isolated point lens having a redshifted mass ranging from \n𝑀\n𝐿\n𝑧\n∈\n(\n1\n,\n10\n5\n)\n𝑀\n⊙\nM\nLz\n\t​\n\n∈(1,10\n5\n)M\n⊙\n\t​\n\n and impact parameter \n𝑦\n∈\n(\n0.01\n,\n5\n)\ny∈(0.01,5), resulting in a maximum mismatch of \n∼\n30\n%\n∼30% with their unlensed counterparts.\nThe population of microlenses, including their distribution and properties.\nThe sensitivity of detectors like LIGO-Virgo.\n\nThese factors can result in a fractional loss of \n20\n%\n20% to \n30\n%\n30% of potentially identifiable microlensed signals when using unlensed templates during the search. The microlens parameters for the most compelling candidate identified in previous microlensing searches fall within a \n1\n𝜎\n1σ range of the higher probability region in the \n𝑀\n𝐿\n𝑧\n−\n𝑦\nM\nLz\n\t​\n\n−y parameter space.\n\nThe Impact of Microlensing on Gravitational Wave Signals\nIntroduction\n\nThe detectability of microlensed signals at the upper limit of \n𝑧\ns\n=\n10\nz\ns\n\t​\n\n=10 using current ground-based detectors is affected by variations in lens mass and impact parameters. This phenomenon has been studied extensively in recent years, with researchers exploring the effects of microlensing on gravitational wave (GW) signals.\n\nMicrolensing Effects on GW Signals\n\nVariations in lens mass and impact parameters can affect the detectability of microlensed signals at the upper limit of \n𝑧\ns\n=\n10\nz\ns\n\t​\n\n=10 using current ground-based detectors. According to research, wave optics effects become significant when the size of the wave is comparable to or larger than the wavelength of most light sources [1]. The microlensing effect on the light curves of fast radio bursts (FRBs) and gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) has been studied, and it is suggested that lensing of GWs can be used to study primordial black holes (PBHs) [2].\n\nParameter Estimation and Detection\n\nThe detectability of a microlensed signal depends on the lens mass \n𝑀\n𝐿\nM\nL\n\t​\n\n and dimensionless source position \n𝑦\ny. A point mass lens between the detector and the source can lead to a smooth frequency-dependent amplification of the gravitational wave signal or magnification combined with the appearance of a second image that interferes with the first, creating a regular, predictable pattern [3]. The increase in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) due to lensing amplification is similar for O3 and O4 noise curves.\n\nMethodologies for Simulating Amplification Curves\n\nA study on gravitational lensing of gravitational waves, specifically the effect of microlens population in lensing galaxies, presents an extensive analysis of wave effects in the LIGO/Virgo frequency band (\n10\n10-\n10\n4\n10\n4\n Hz) [4]. The study considers a wide range of strong lensing (macro) magnifications and corresponding surface microlens densities found in lensing galaxies to generate realizations of the amplification factor.\n\nStrong Lensing and Microlensing\n\nThe strong lensing would amplify the microlensing effect, further boosting our ability to detect the microlensing signatures. The microlens mass is better recovered when incorporating strong lensing [5]. The amplification factor \n𝐹\n(\n𝑓\n)\nF(f) of the isolated point-mass lens model is given by F(w) = \\exp \\left$$ \\frac{1}{4}\nln\n⁡\nln\\left(\n\\frac{i}{2}\n\\right)\n+\n+\\frac{1}{2}\nln\n⁡\nln\\left(\n\\frac{i}{2}\n−\n𝑓\n−f\\right)\n−\n−\\frac{1}{2}\nln\n⁡\nln\\left(\n\\frac{i}{2}\n+\n𝑓\n+f\\right)\\right$$$ wherew = \n𝑦\n2\n2\ny\n\t​\n\n \\left( \n𝑓\n𝑓\n0\nf\n0\n\t​\n\nf\n\t​\n\n \\right)^{1/3}$$ and f_0 = \\frac{c}{2 \\pi} \\left( \n𝑀\n𝐿\n𝐷\n𝐿\nD\nL\n\t​\n\nM\nL\n\t​\n\n\t​\n\n \\right)^{1/2}.\n\nReferences\narXiv.org\nResearchGate\narXiv.org PDF\nhttps://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-pdf/531/1/764/57707112/stae836.pdf\nhttps://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/10.1093/mnras/stae836\nRoyal Society Publishing\n[1] https://repository.ubn.ru.nl/bitstream/handle/2066/319170/319170.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y\n[2] https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.12394\n[3] https://diposit.ub.edu/dspace/bitstream/2445/213153/1/834177.pdf\n[4] https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.03946\n[5] https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.03308\n\n</FINAL_DETAILED_REPORT>", "marvel_deepsearch_score": 10, "evaluation_model_type": "openai", "evaluation_model_name": "gpt-4o-mini", "qa_model_type": "openai", "qa_model_name": "gpt-4o-mini", "gpt4o_mini_answer_relevancy": 0.9, "gpt4o_mini_answer_correctness": 0.65, "gpt4o_mini_faithfulness": 0.3, "marvel_standard_answer_relevancy": 0.0, "marvel_standard_answer_correctness": 0.0, "marvel_standard_faithfulness": 0.0, "marvel_deepsearch_answer_relevancy": 0.95, "marvel_deepsearch_answer_correctness": 0.92, "marvel_deepsearch_faithfulness": 0.92}

For GW150914 and GW170814, the constraints on the scalar-mode amplitude to tensor-mode amplitude ratio are \n≲\n0.20\n≲0.20 and \n≲\n0.068\n≲0.068, respectively. These findings suggest that General Relativity is consistent with the observations within the strong-field regime, limiting the scope of alternative theories of gravity. The analysis of GW150914 and GW170814 has provided valuable insights into the polarization modes of gravitational waves, confirming the predictions of General Relativity and constraining alternative polarization modes. The data from GW170814 are consistent with Einstein’s theory, disfavoring alternative polarization combinations that are forbidden by General Relativity. Purely tensor polarization was strongly favored over purely scalar or vector polarizations. The study aimed to evaluate the amplitude of the scalar mode mixed with the ordinary tensor modes. The implications of the constrained scalar-tensor mixed polarization modes for the events GW150914 and GW170814 on the properties of merging binary systems are related to the detection of gravitational waves and the testing of general relativity in strong-field, highly dynamical regimes. According to General Relativity (GR), gravitational waves are transverse, stretching and squeezing spacetime in the plane perpendicular to their direction of travel, with only two allowed types of distortions, called “+” (\n+\n+) and “” (\n×\n×) polarizations. Studies have shown that the data from GW170814 are consistent with Einstein’s theory, disfavoring alternative polarization combinations that are forbidden by General Relativity [@\"https://www.aei.mpg.de/187070/GW170814-Science-Summary.pdf\"]. An analysis of events GW150914 and GW170814 revealed that purely tensor polarization was strongly favored over purely scalar or vector polarizations [@\"https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.119.141101.pdf\"]. The significance of GW170814 was confirmed on the full network of three detectors by an independent coherent analysis, which reported a false-alarm rate of \n1\n1 in \n5900\n5900 years, improving to more than an order of magnitude over the two LIGO detectors only, which yielded a false-alarm rate of approximately \n1\n1 in \n300\n300 years [@\"https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.119.141101.pdf\"]. A direct search for scalar-tensor mixed polarization modes of gravitational waves from compact binaries in a strong regime was conducted for events GW150914 and GW170814 [@\"https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.105.084019.pdf\"]. The study aimed to evaluate the amplitude of the scalar mode mixed with the ordinary tensor modes. The implications of the polarization mode findings from GW150914 and GW170814 on our understanding of General Relativity and alternative theories of gravity are that they support General Relativity, with the detected gravitational waves characterized by two tensor polarizations, and no clear evidence for alternative polarization modes that would indicate a violation of General Relativity. The detected gravitational waves are consistent with having only two tensor polarizations, as predicted by General Relativity. While alternative theories of gravity allow for up to six polarizations (including vector and scalar modes), the observations of GW150914 and GW170814 do not provide evidence for these alternative modes. Instead, they favor the purely tensor polarization model over scalar-only or vector-only models. This consistency with General Relativity is reported in multiple studies, although some analyses suggest that Einstein’s theory could be ruled out at certain confidence levels when considering specific events or methodologies. Overall, the findings reinforce our understanding of gravitational waves within the framework of General Relativity. </TASK_OUTPUT>\n\nSUMMARY\n\n<TASK_OUTPUT>\n\nSummary of Findings on Gravitational Wave Polarization Modes from GW150914 and GW170814\n\nThe analysis of gravitational wave events GW150914 and GW170814 has provided significant insights into the polarization modes of gravitational waves. According to General Relativity (GR), gravitational waves are transverse, stretching and squeezing spacetime in the plane perpendicular to their direction of travel, with only two allowed types of distortions, called “+” (\n+\n+) and “” (\n×\n×) polarizations.\n\nStudies have shown that the data from GW170814 are consistent with Einstein’s theory, disfavoring alternative polarization combinations that are forbidden by General Relativity [1]. An analysis of events GW150914 and GW170814 revealed that purely tensor polarization was strongly favored over purely scalar or vector polarizations [2]. These results were obtained by projecting the wave's amplitude onto the three detectors to probe gravitational-wave polarizations geometrically and comparing the tensor-only mode with scalar-only and vector-only modes.\n\nFurther analysis of GW170814 and GW170817 provided findings regarding the polarization modes of gravitational waves, specifically constraining the scalar amplitude \n𝐴\n𝑆\n2\nA\nS2\n\t​\n\n and the ratio of the scalar mode amplitude to the tensor mode amplitude: \n𝑅\n𝑆\n𝑇\n<\n∼\n0.20\nR\nST\n\t​\n\n<∼0.20 for GW170814 [3]. The posterior probability distributions for the chirp mass in the source frame, the luminosity distance, the inclination angle, and the scalar amplitudes under the scalar-tensor hypothesis \n𝐻\n𝑆\n𝑇\nH\nST\n\t​\n\n were also obtained.\n\nThe implications of the polarization mode findings from GW150914 and GW170814 on our understanding of General Relativity and alternative theories of gravity are that they support General Relativity. The detected gravitational waves are consistent with having only two tensor polarizations, as predicted by General Relativity. While alternative theories of gravity allow for up to six polarizations (including vector and scalar modes), the observations of GW150914 and GW170814 do not provide evidence for these alternative modes. Instead, they favor the purely tensor polarization model over scalar-only or vector-only models.\n\nReferences\n\n[1] GW170814 Science Summary [2] Physical Review Letters [3] National Science Foundation [4] Physical Review D [5] Scalar-tensor mixed polarization search of gravitational waves [6] https://hal.science/hal-01669499/document [7] https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.105.084019.pdf [8] https://www.researchgate.net/publication/351298940_Scalar-tensor_mixed_polarization_search_of_gravitational_waves [9] https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.00253 [10] https://www.researchgate.net/publication/394175298_Constraining_noncommutative_spacetime_with_GW150914_and_GW190814.pdf [11] https://physics.aps.org/articles/v9/52 [12] https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.119.141101.pdf [13] https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.02938 [14] https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41114-024-00054-9 [15] https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.110.084057 [16] https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589004225014038 [17] https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6382/ab8f64/ampdf [18] https://cplberry.com/tag/polarizations [19] https://cplberry.com/tag/polarizations/&gt [20] https://hal.science/hal-01669499/document [21] https://hal.science/hal-01669499/document&gt [22] https://www.researchgate.net/publication/394175298_Constraining_noncommutative_spacetime_with_GW150914_and_GW190814 [23] https://www.researchgate.net/publication/394175298_Constraining_noncommutative_spacetime_with_GW150914_and_GW190814&gt [24] https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjs/s11734-021-00080-6 [25] https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjs/s11734-021-00080-6&gt [26] https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.119.141101.pdf [27] https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.119.141101 [28] https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.119.141101&gt [29] https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/136085/PhysRevD.100.104036.pdf?sequence=2 [30] https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/136085/PhysRevD.100.104036.pdf?gt%3B=&quot%3B=&sequence=2 [31] https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.104.024012.pdf [32] https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.104.024012&gt [33] https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.110.084057.pdf [34] https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.110.084057&gt </TASK_OUTPUT>\n\nREFERENCES\n\n<TASK_OUTPUT>\n\nhttps://hal.science/hal-01669499/document\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.105.084019\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/351298940_Scalar-tensor_mixed_polarization_search_of_gravitational_waves\nhttps://www.aei.mpg.de/187070/GW170814-Science-Summary.pdf\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.119.141101.pdf\nhttps://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10356135\nhttps://inspirehep.net/literature/1823799\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.105.084019.pdf\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2105.00253\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/394175298_Constraining_noncommutative_spacetime_with_GW150914_and_GW190814.pdf\nhttps://physics.aps.org/articles/v9/52\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.02938\nhttps://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41114-024-00054-9\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.110.084057\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589004225014038\nhttps://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6382/ab8f64/ampdf\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.119.091101.pdf\nhttps://cplberry.com/tag/polarizations\nhttps://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjs/s11734-021-00080-6\nhttps://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/136085/PhysRevD.100.104036.pdf?sequence=2\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.104.024012.pdf </TASK_OUTPUT>", "marvel_deepsearch_score": 10, "evaluation_model_type": "openai", "evaluation_model_name": "gpt-4o-mini", "qa_model_type": "openai", "qa_model_name": "gpt-4o-mini", "gpt4o_mini_answer_relevancy": 0.98, "gpt4o_mini_answer_correctness": 0.92, "gpt4o_mini_faithfulness": 0.92, "marvel_standard_answer_relevancy": 0.9, "marvel_standard_answer_correctness": 0.9, "marvel_standard_faithfulness": 0.85, "marvel_deepsearch_answer_relevancy": 0.965, "marvel_deepsearch_answer_correctness": 0.98, "marvel_deepsearch_faithfulness": 0.98}

This has significant implications in astro-physics, cosmology, nuclear, and fundamental physics. The direct observation of compact binary mergers has confirmed several hypotheses in astrophysics.\n\nSignificance of Accurate Parameter Estimation\n\nThe significance of accurate parameter estimation in gravitational-wave astronomy, particularly in the context of binary mergers, lies in its crucial role for prompt follow-up of electromagnetic and astro-particle counterparts accompanying important transients, such as binary neutron-star and black-hole neutron-star mergers. Accurate parameter estimation enables fast dissemination of detected event parameters, allowing the observing community to make best use of its resources. This is particularly relevant in the field of multimessenger astronomy, as demonstrated by the observation of the binary neutron star merger GW170817 in gravitational and electromagnetic waves.\n\nAccurate parameter estimation also facilitates the exploration of properties of compact objects, such as those observed in GW190814. The observation of GW190814 marks the beginning of gravitational-wave astronomy's exploration of the properties of compact objects that are more massive.\n\nBayesian Inference Methods\n\nBayesian inference methods, such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and Nested Sampling (NS), play a crucial role in enhancing the accuracy and reliability of parameter estimation in gravitational-wave astronomy for binary mergers. These methods are utilized to reconstruct sky maps of binary mergers, determine distances and properties of merging objects, and study the formation mechanism of black hole binaries.\n\nThe use of Bayesian inference methods in gravitational-wave astronomy has several benefits:\n\nAccurate parameter estimation: Bayesian inference methods provide accurate and reliable estimates of model parameters, such as the masses, spins, and merger times of binary black holes and neutron stars.\nModel selection: Bayesian inference methods allow for model selection, enabling researchers to compare the evidence for different models and determine which one is statistically preferred by the data.\nUncertainty quantification: Bayesian inference methods provide a way to quantify the uncertainties associated with parameter estimates, which is essential for making robust conclusions about the properties of gravitational-wave sources.\nChallenges and Methods\n\nOne of the key challenges of real-time detection and parameter estimation of gravitational waves from compact binary mergers is the computational cost of conventional matched-filtering and Bayesian inference approaches, which is computationally prohibitive when applied to the full signal parameter space available to the gravitational-wave detectors. Training deep neural networks to identify specific signals and learn a computationally efficient representation of the mapping between gravitational-wave signals and their parameters allows both detection and inference to be done quickly and reliably, with high sensitivity and accuracy.\n\nVarious methods have been proposed to improve the accuracy and efficiency of parameter estimation, including the use of Bayesian inference, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), and Nested Sampling methods. A method called simple-pe has been introduced, which uses polarization, higher gravitational wave multipoles, or spin-induced orbital precession to generate rapid parameter estimation results for binary mergers.\n\nImportance of Accurate Parameter Estimation\n\nAccurate parameter estimation is essential to gravitational-wave astronomy, particularly in the context of binary mergers. It enables optimal prioritization of observations, allowing for the efficient use of resources. Rapid measurement of a gravitational-wave event's masses and spins is crucial in determining the nature of the event. Accurate estimates of binary properties, such as component masses and spins, are crucial for determining the likelihood of an electromagnetic counterpart.\n\nThe accurate inference of binary neutron stars (BNSs) from gravitational-wave (GW) data is a critical challenge facing multi-messenger astronomy. Fast analysis results are crucial for directing electromagnetic searches for prompt or even precursor signals.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, accurate parameter estimation is crucial for maximizing the scientific impact of gravitational-wave astronomy. It enables prompt follow-up of electromagnetic and astro-particle counterparts, facilitates the exploration of properties of compact objects, and allows for optimal prioritization of observations.

These algorithms aim to effectively utilize telescope resources by prioritizing galaxies within the localization volume of a GW event, based on their likelihood of hosting the electromagnetic counterpart.\n\n## Purpose and Requirements\nThe primary goal of these algorithms is to target the most likely host galaxies for observation, where galaxies are prioritized based on their mass, as the merger rate will scale with stellar mass, proximity to the highest probability regions of the skymap, and distance consistency with the GW inference. A galaxy catalogue used for this purpose should satisfy two primary requirements: it should be as complete as possible, currently limited by the availability of accurate redshifts, and provide information about galaxy masses and star formation rates (SFR).\n\n## Catalog of Nearby Galaxies\nThe catalog of nearby galaxies, such as the NED-LVS, contains key galaxy parameters like masses and star formation rates (SFR), which are used for ranking galaxies. The catalog is $\\sim70\\%$ complete up to distances of $300–400$ Mpc and nearly $100\\%$ complete to about $450–500$ Mpc for the most massive galaxies. The NED-LVS catalogue is used as the base catalogue, which contains $\\sim1.9$ million objects to a distance of $1000$ Mpc.\n\n## Specific Information and Algorithms\nThe algorithms consider factors such as galaxy mass, 3D probability of containing the source, and catalogue completeness. For instance, the probability of containing the source is expected to be proportional to galaxy mass, $p \\propto M$. The use of galaxy catalogs can improve the probability of successful imaging by $\\sim10\\%$ to $\\sim300\\%$ relative to follow-up strategies that do not utilize galaxy catalogs.\n\n## Examples of Catalogs\nExamples of catalogs used for galaxy prioritization scheduling algorithms include GLADE (Galaxy List for Astrophysical Data Exploration), which includes both inactive and active galaxies as potential hosts of astrophysical sources of gravitational waves. Another example is the catalog created by the NANOGrav collaboration, which includes $45,000$ galaxies to detect gravitational waves using pulsars.\n\n## Conclusion\nIn conclusion, the purpose of galaxy prioritization scheduling algorithms in the context of gravitational wave (GW) sources is to prioritize pointings based on the relative probability of successful imaging. The catalog of nearby galaxies includes key galaxy parameters like masses and star formation rates (SFR), which are used for ranking galaxies.\n\n## References\n* [https://arxiv.org/html/2507.11635v1](https://arxiv.org/html/2507.11635v1)\n* [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.11635](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.11635)\n* [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11982929/](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11982929/)\n* [https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9f36/pdf](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9f36/pdf)\n* [https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/479/2/2374/5046493](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/479/2/2374/5046493)\n* [https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/784/1/8](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/784/1/8)\n* [https://news.vanderbilt.edu/2021/06/23/research-snapshot-astrophysicists-prepare-for-age-of-multimessenger-astronomy-build-galaxy-catalog-to-study-black-holes/](https://news.vanderbilt.edu/2021/06/23/research-snapshot-astrophysicists-prepare-for-age-of-multimessenger-astronomy-build-galaxy-catalog-to-study-black-holes/)", "marvel_standard_score": 7, "marvel_deepsearch_answer": "KEY_FACTS\n\n<TASK_OUTPUT>\n\nThe purpose of galaxy prioritization scheduling algorithms in the context of gravitational wave (GW) sources is to optimize the follow-up observations of electromagnetic counterparts to GW events by prioritizing galaxies based on their likelihood of hosting the electromagnetic counterpart.\nThe catalog of nearby galaxies, such as the NED-LVS, includes key galaxy parameters like masses and star formation rates (SFR), which are used for ranking galaxies.\nThe specific information included in the catalog is:\nStar formation rate (\n𝑃\n3\n𝐷\n𝑃\n𝑆\n𝐹\n𝑅\nP\n3DP\nSFR\n\t​\n\n\t​\n\n)\nStellar mass (\n𝑃\n3\n𝐷\n𝑃\n𝑀\n𝑠\n𝑡\n𝑎\n𝑟\nP\n3DP\nMstar\n\t​\n\n\t​\n\n)\nSpecific star formation rate (\n𝑃\n3\n𝐷\n𝑃\n𝑠\n𝑆\n𝐹\n𝑅\nP\n3DP\nsSFR\n\t​\n\n\t​\n\n)\nWISE W1 luminosity (\n𝑃\n𝐿\n𝑢\n𝑚\n𝑊\n1\nP\nLumW1\n\t​\n\n), used as a proxy for stellar mass.\nThe catalog is \n∼\n70\n%\n∼70% complete up to distances of \n300\n–\n400\n300–400 Mpc and nearly \n100\n%\n100% complete to about \n450\n–\n500\n450–500 Mpc for the most massive galaxies.\nThe NED-LVS catalogue contains \n∼\n1.9\n∼1.9 million objects to a distance of \n1000\n1000 Mpc [@\"url:https://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/gwf/overview\"].\nThe algorithms consider factors such as galaxy mass, 3D probability of containing the source, and catalogue completeness.\nThe use of galaxy catalogs can improve the probability of successful imaging by \n∼\n10\n%\n∼10% to \n∼\n300\n%\n∼300% relative to follow-up strategies that do not utilize galaxy catalogs [@\"url:https://arxiv.org/html/2507.11635v1\"].\nThe NED-LVS is \n10\n%\n−\n20\n%\n10%−20% more complete than GLADE and HECATE beyond \n80\n80 Mpc.\nThe NED-LVS uses UV and IR fluxes available in NED from all-sky surveys to derive physical properties and estimate completeness relative to the expected local luminosity density. </TASK_OUTPUT>\nFINER_DETAILS\n\n<TASK_OUTPUT> The purpose of the galaxy prioritization scheduling algorithms in the context of gravitational wave (GW) sources is to optimize the follow-up observations of electromagnetic counterparts to GW events by prioritizing galaxies within the localization volume of a GW event based on their likelihood of hosting the electromagnetic counterpart.

Galaxy distances and localization volumes play a crucial role in the prioritization of galaxies for follow-up observations of gravitational wave sources [@\"url:https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017MNRAS.466.2212A/abstract\"].

By convolving the gravitational wave (GW) localization region with the distribution of galaxies, the search region can be reduced, and the chances of detecting the electromagnetic (EM) counterpart can be increased [@\"url:https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2020/02/aa36573-19/aa36573-19.html\"].

The catalog is used as the base catalogue, which contains \n∼\n1.9\n∼1.9 million objects to a distance of \n1000\n1000 Mpc. The limitations and potential biases in current galaxy prioritization scheduling algorithms and catalogs of nearby galaxies that might affect their effectiveness in identifying host galaxies of gravitational wave sources include: incompleteness of galaxy catalogs, limited range and biases in galaxy catalogs, uncertainty in the link between BNS merger rate and galaxy properties, and potential biases in host galaxy properties. Examples of catalogs used for galaxy prioritization scheduling algorithms include GLADE (Galaxy List for Astrophysical Data Exploration), which includes both inactive and active galaxies as potential hosts of astrophysical sources of gravitational waves. The NED-LVS and GLADE catalogs are two widely used galaxy catalogs in astronomical research, with distinct characteristics in terms of completeness, distance range, and galaxy parameters. NED-LVS is nearly \n100\n%\n100% complete for the most massive galaxies up to a distance of \n450\n−\n500\n450−500 Mpc, while GLADE is limited by the availability of accurate redshifts. The differences in completeness and distance range between NED-LVS and GLADE catalogs can significantly impact the effectiveness of galaxy prioritization scheduling algorithms. Additionally, the galaxy prioritization scheduling algorithms account for uncertainties in galaxy distances and localization volumes by utilizing methods such as Hierarchical Equal Area isoLatitude Pixelation (HEALPix) maps, gravitational wave probability skymaps with right ascension and declination information, and 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional localization information provided by GW detectors [@\"url:https://arxiv.org/html/2507.11635v1\"]. These uncertainties affect the effectiveness of follow-up observations, but coordinated efforts and optimized algorithms can mitigate these impacts. The primary goal of these algorithms is to target the most likely host galaxies for observation, where galaxies are prioritized based on their mass, as the merger rate will scale with stellar mass, proximity to the highest probability regions of the skymap, and distance consistency with the GW inference [@\"url:https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9f36/pdf\"]. The development of galaxy catalogs, such as the GWGC and NED-LVS, has improved the completeness and accuracy of galaxy prioritization [@\"url:https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/479/2/2374/5046493\"]. The use of galaxy catalogs for follow-up observations of gravitational wave sources has implications for the detection rate of electromagnetic counterparts and the efficiency of telescope resources. By using galaxy catalogs, the number of required follow-up observations can be significantly reduced, making it possible to detect faint transients that may be beyond the reach of most survey telescopes. Furthermore, machine learning algorithms can be integrated with existing galaxy catalogs to constrain redshift ranges and optimize electromagnetic follow-ups, offering several advantages in predicting the likelihood of a galaxy hosting a gravitational wave source, including efficient processing of large data volumes, detection of complex patterns, and improved estimates of galaxy properties. The limitations and potential biases in current galaxy prioritization scheduling algorithms and catalogs of nearby galaxies include: incompleteness of galaxy catalogs, limited range and biases in galaxy catalogs, uncertainty in the link between BNS merger rate and galaxy properties, potential biases in host galaxy properties, and limitations in the three-dimensional localization uncertainty. The convolution of the 3D-localisation uncertainty by the distribution of galaxies can potentially decrease the number of observations needed to cover the most plausible source locations. </TASK_OUTPUT>\n\nSUMMARY\n\n<TASK_OUTPUT>\n\nThe purpose of galaxy prioritization scheduling algorithms in the context of gravitational wave (GW) sources is to optimize the follow-up observations of electromagnetic counterparts to GW events.

Here are the main considerations:\n\n1. **Energy Scale of Inflation**: The energy scale of inflation must be sufficiently low to avoid excessive heating of the universe that could disrupt BBN. If inflation occurs at too high an energy scale, it could lead to a significant production of particles that would alter the conditions necessary for BBN.\n\n2. **Duration of Inflation**: The duration of the inflationary phase should be short enough to allow for a smooth transition to the radiation-dominated era without introducing too many additional degrees of freedom or particles that could interfere with nucleosynthesis.\n\n3. **Gravitational Wave Spectrum**: The spectrum of gravitational waves produced during inflation should be such that it does not lead to significant energy density contributions that could affect the expansion rate of the universe during the BBN epoch. This typically means that the amplitude of the gravitational waves must be low enough to not dominate the energy density.\n\n4. **Reheating Phase**: The process of reheating after inflation must be controlled. If the reheating temperature is too high, it could lead to the production of additional particles that would alter the conditions for BBN. A gradual and controlled reheating process can help mitigate this issue.\n\n5. **Scalar and Tensor Perturbations**: The generation of gravitational waves is often associated with scalar perturbations in the inflationary model. The relationship between scalar and tensor perturbations must be such that the tensor-to-scalar ratio \\( r \\) remains within observational limits while not affecting the BBN conditions.\n\n6. **Model Selection**: The choice of inflationary model is crucial. Some models predict a large tensor-to-scalar ratio, while others predict a smaller one. Models that predict a smaller \\( r \\) are generally more favorable for avoiding interference with BBN.\n\n7. **Decay Channels**: The decay channels of the inflaton field (the hypothetical field responsible for inflation) should be such that they do not produce too many relativistic degrees of freedom that could alter the expansion rate during BBN.\n\nIn summary, to generate observable primordial gravitational waves without affecting BBN, one must carefully consider the energy scale and duration of inflation, the characteristics of the gravitational wave spectrum, the reheating process, and the specific inflationary model being used.

These conditions include specific amplitude and frequency ranges for the gravitational waves. The amplitude should be within limits such as $\\Omega_{gw} h^2 <6.9 \\times10^{-6}$ for homogeneous initial conditions, and the frequency should be around $\\sim10^{-15}$ Hz. The implications of inhomogeneous initial conditions on the generation of observable primordial gravitational waves without affecting BBN involve various mechanisms, including the formation of primordial black holes and inhomogeneous inflation scenarios. These conditions can lead to the production of gravitational waves, but strict constraints exist to ensure that BBN predictions remain unaffected. The relationship between the frequency range of primordial gravitational waves and the constraints imposed by BBN on the generation of observable primordial gravitational waves is that BBN imposes a lower limit of $\\sim10^{-10}$ Hz on the frequency range, while the frequency range of primordial gravitational waves extends to much lower frequencies, down to $\\sim10^{-15}$ Hz. The constraints on the number of relativistic degrees of freedom during BBN ($N_{eff}$) further limit the energy density of primordial gravitational waves. The conditions necessary for generating observable primordial gravitational waves without affecting BBN are studied in the context of inflation, which is believed to produce a primordial gravitational field. The implications of inhomogeneous initial conditions on the generation of observable primordial gravitational waves without affecting BBN involve various mechanisms, including the formation of primordial black holes and inhomogeneous inflation scenarios. These conditions can lead to the production of gravitational waves, but strict constraints exist to ensure that BBN predictions remain unaffected. For instance, the maximum fraction of primordial black holes cannot exceed $10^{-3}$ and decreases to $10^{-9}$ for $M_{\\rm PBH} \\sim5 \\times10^{8}$ g. The relationship between the equation of state of the epoch intervening reheating and the terminal phase of radiation domination and the generation of observable primordial gravitational waves without affecting BBN is that changes in the equation of state can affect the propagation of primordial gravitational waves. This relationship is rooted in how the equation of state influences the thermal history of the universe, which in turn affects the processing of primordial gravitational waves, allowing for their generation without impacting BBN. Future CMB experiments, like Planck and CMBPol, are expected to allow sensitivities to $\\Omega_{gw} h^2 <1.4 \\times10^{-6}$. The late-time spectral density has a plateau at high frequencies that can be enhanced or suppressed relative to the standard thermal history, depending on the equation of state of the epoch intervening reheating and the terminal phase of radiation domination. The suppression factor $μ$ can be expressed as a function of $ϕ$ parameters, and the magnitude of the suppression factor can be used to constrain new physics. The relationship between the equation of state of the epoch intervening reheating and the terminal phase of radiation domination and the generation of observable primordial gravitational waves without affecting BBN is rooted in the physics of first-order phase transitions in the early universe. The effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom $g_{*}$ and the equation of state parameter $w$ play a crucial role in determining the evolution of the universe and the production of gravitational waves.

The gravitational field of the SMBH dominates the dynamics of the smaller object (the inspiraling compact object, such as a stellar-mass black hole or neutron star). The gravitational potential energy and the orbital mechanics are influenced by the mass of the SMBH, which determines the strength of the gravitational field at a given distance.\n\n2. **Kepler's Laws**: According to Kepler's laws of planetary motion, the orbital period of an object in a circular orbit around a massive body is related to the mass of the central body and the radius of the orbit. Specifically, for a circular orbit, the orbital frequency \\( \\omega \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\omega^2 = \\frac{GM}{r^3}\n   \\]\n   where \\( G \\) is the gravitational constant, \\( M \\) is the mass of the black hole, and \\( r \\) is the orbital radius. This relationship shows that for a given mass \\( M \\), the orbital distance \\( r \\) affects the orbital frequency and thus the dynamics of the inspiral.\n\n3. **Energy Radiation and Gravitational Waves**: As the compact object spirals into the SMBH, it loses energy primarily through the emission of gravitational waves. The rate of energy loss due to gravitational wave emission is influenced by the orbital distance and the mass of the black hole. The energy radiated in gravitational waves increases as the compact object gets closer to the black hole, particularly as it approaches the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO), which is determined by the mass of the black hole.\n\n4. **Scaling Relations**: The energy emitted in gravitational waves scales with the mass of the black hole and the orbital parameters. For a given mass ratio (where the mass of the compact object is much smaller than that of the SMBH), the frequency of the gravitational waves emitted during the inspiral is related to the mass of the black hole and the orbital distance. The gravitational wave frequency \\( f \\) can be approximated as:\n   \\[\n   f \\propto \\frac{M^{1/2}}{r^{3/2}}\n   \\]\n   This indicates that as the compact object spirals closer to the black hole (decreasing \\( r \\)), the frequency of the emitted gravitational waves increases, which is critical for the detection of these signals by observatories like LIGO and Virgo.\n\nIn summary, the relationship between the orbital distance and the mass of a black hole in the context of EMRIs is characterized by gravitational dynamics governed by Kepler's laws, the energy loss through gravitational waves, and the scaling of frequencies with respect to the mass of the black hole and the orbital parameters.

This system is a target for future space-borne, milli-Hz gravitational-wave (GW) detectors, such as the laser interferometer space antenna (LISA) ([Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42005-018-0053-0)). EMRIs involve a stellar-mass compact object (SCO) spiraling into a massive black hole (MBH) with a mass $M$ residing within a relaxed galactic center ([LISA](https://lisa.nasa.gov/downloads/forScientists/whitePapers/Potential_of_EMRIs.pdf)).\n\n## Orbital Dynamics and Gravitational Wave Emission\n------------------------------------------------\n\nThe orbit of a small compact object, such as a stellar mass black hole, shrinks until it plunges into the central supermassive black hole due to gravitational wave emission ([Astrobites](https://astrobites.org/2018/07/05/small-black-hole-meets-big-black-hole/)). The gravitational wave emission is related to the masses of the black holes, with the supermassive black hole being approximately a million times larger than the small black hole. If an object passes too close to the central supermassive black hole, it will make a direct plunge across the event horizon, producing a brief violent burst of gravitational radiation. On the other hand, if the object passes too far, it will not be captured ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_mass_ratio_inspiral)).\n\n## Role of Spin and Orbital Distance\n-----------------------------------\n\nThe role of the spin of the central supermassive black hole in the formation and evolution of EMRIs is crucial, with capture orbits accumulating thousands of cycles in the detector band when the spin is taken into account ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_mass_ratio_inspiral)). The relationship between the orbital distance and the mass of a black hole can be understood when a star scatters below a certain threshold, represented by the \"grey line\", at which point gravitational radiation can extract energy from the orbit faster than it is likely to be perturbed by star–star interactions ([MNRAS](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/438/1/573/1035454)).\n\n## Precision Measurements with EMRIs\n--------------------------------------\n\nLISA observations of EMRIs will enable high-precision measurements of the physical characteristics of these systems, including redshifted masses, massive black hole spin, and orbital eccentricity, with fractional errors $\\sim10^{-4}$–$10^{-6}$ ([LISA](https://lisa.nasa.gov/downloads/forScientists/whitePapers/Potential_of_EMRIs.pdf)). The mass of the MBH can be measured with a precision of $\\sim10^{-6}$ and the spin with a precision of $\\sim10^{-4}$. EMRIs will provide valuable information about stellar dynamics in galactic nuclei and precise data about massive black hole populations.\n\n## Conclusion\n----------\n\nIn conclusion, the relationship between the orbital distance and the mass of a black hole in the context of energy radiation from an EMRI orbiting a supermassive black hole is complex and influenced by various factors, including the spin of the central black hole and the orbital dynamics of the system. Further studies and observations of EMRIs will provide valuable insights into the properties of black holes and the behavior of matter in extreme environments.\n\n## References\n--------------\n\n* [Astrobites](https://astrobites.org/2018/07/05/small-black-hole-meets-big-black-hole/)\n* [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42005-018-0053-0)\n* [AAS Nova](https://aasnova.org/2025/08/08/supermassive-black-holes-and-stripped-subgiants-significant-signals-for-future-gravitational-wave-detectors/)\n* [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_mass_ratio_inspiral)\n* [LISA](https://lisa.nasa.gov/downloads/forScientists/whitePapers/Potential_of_EMRIs.pdf)\n* [MNRAS](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/438/1/573/1035454)\n* [ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0370269325003910)", "marvel_standard_score": 6, "marvel_deepsearch_answer": "KEY_FACTS\n\n<TASK_OUTPUT>\n\nThe relationship between the orbital distance and the mass of a black hole in the context of energy radiation from an EMRI orbiting a supermassive black hole is complex and influenced by various factors, including the spin of the central black hole and the orbital dynamics of the system [@\"url:https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/438/1/573/1035454\"].\nGravitational radiation can extract energy from the orbit faster than it is perturbed by star–star interactions when a star scatters below a certain threshold, represented by the \"grey line\" [@\"url:https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/438/1/573/1035454\"].\nThe spin of the supermassive black hole affects the orbital motion of the EMRI, which in turn affects the energy radiation emitted by the EMRI [@\"url:https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/429/4/3155/1013578\"].\nFor prograde orbits, a larger spin results in a smaller effective size of the massive black hole (MBH), while for retrograde orbits, it results in a larger effective size [@\"url:https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/429/4/3155/1013578\"].\nLISA observations of EMRIs will enable high-precision measurements of the physical characteristics of these systems, including redshifted masses, massive black hole spin, and orbital eccentricity, with fractional errors \n∼\n10\n−\n4\n∼10\n−4\n–\n10\n−\n6\n10\n−6\n [@\"url:https://lisa.nasa.gov/downloads/forScientists/whitePapers/Potential_of_EMRIs.pdf\"].\nThe mass of the stellar-mass black hole affects the energy radiation from an EMRI orbiting a supermassive black hole, influencing the gravitational waves emitted as the stellar-mass black hole spirals into the supermassive black hole [@\"url:https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.81.104014\"].\nThe orbit of a small compact object, such as a stellar mass black hole, shrinks until it plunges into the central supermassive black hole due to gravitational wave emission [@\"url:https://astrobites.org/2018/07/05/small-black-hole-meets-big-black-hole\"].\nThe gravitational wave emission is related to the masses of the black holes, with the supermassive black hole being approximately a million times larger than the small black hole [@\"url:https://astrobites.org/2018/07/05/small-black-hole-meets-big-black-hole\"].\nThe role of the spin of the central supermassive black hole in the formation and evolution of EMRIs is crucial, with capture orbits accumulating thousands of cycles in the detector band when the spin is taken into account [@\"url:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_mass_ratio_inspiral\"]. </TASK_OUTPUT>\nFINER_DETAILS\n\n<TASK_OUTPUT> The relationship between the orbital distance and the mass of a black hole in the context of energy radiation from an extreme-mass-ratio inspiral (EMRI) orbiting a supermassive black hole is complex and influenced by various factors, including the spin of the central black hole and the orbital dynamics of the system.

In the context of LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory) and its spectroscopy horizon, the Rayleigh condition plays a crucial role in determining the sensitivity and resolution of the gravitational wave signals that LIGO can detect.\n\n### Significance of the Rayleigh Condition in LIGO\n\n1. **Spectroscopy Horizon**: The spectroscopy horizon of LIGO refers to the range of frequencies over which it can effectively detect gravitational waves. This is influenced by the sensitivity of the interferometer, which is determined by factors such as the laser power, the length of the arms, and the noise characteristics of the system.\n\n2. **Resolvability of Harmonic Modes**: Gravitational waves can be thought of as perturbations in spacetime that can be decomposed into various harmonic modes (e.g., different frequencies and amplitudes). The Rayleigh condition states that two sources (or modes) can be resolved if they are separated by a distance greater than or equal to a certain minimum, which is typically related to the wavelength of the light used in the interferometer.\n\n3. **Implications for Detection**: In LIGO, the ability to resolve different harmonic modes of gravitational waves is critical for distinguishing between different sources of gravitational waves, such as binary black hole mergers or neutron star collisions. If the frequency separation between two signals is less than what the Rayleigh criterion allows, LIGO may not be able to distinguish them as separate events, leading to a loss of information about the sources.\n\n4. **Noise and Sensitivity**: The Rayleigh condition also ties into the noise characteristics of LIGO. The sensitivity of the detector is affected by various noise sources (e.g., seismic noise, thermal noise, shot noise), which can limit the ability to resolve closely spaced frequencies. The design and operation of LIGO aim to minimize these noise sources to maximize the effective spectroscopy horizon.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, the Rayleigh condition is significant in the context of LIGO's spectroscopy horizon as it sets the limits on the resolvability of different harmonic modes of gravitational waves.

In the context of LIGO's spectroscopy horizon, the Rayleigh condition plays a crucial role in assessing the detectability and resolvability of different harmonic modes emitted by black holes.\n\nIntroduction to the Rayleigh Criterion\n\nThe Rayleigh criterion states that the minimum resolvable detail in an imaging process is diffraction-limited when the first diffraction minimum of the image of one source point coincides with the maximum of another. This criterion leads to a limit of resolution on the order of the wavelength of the wave used to image it.

The detectability of modes is affected by the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), with higher SNRs required to resolve closely spaced modes. According to M Lagos et al. (2025), the (440) mode has a lower SNR than the (44\nℓ\nℓ) mode, and the maximum redshifts for resolving the detectability are quoted. Studies have reported that resolving overtones requires an SNR larger than \n∼\n30\n∼30. The condition is used to assess the detectability of different harmonic modes and is crucial for performing no-hair theorem tests, which state that a black hole spacetime in general relativity is uniquely defined by at most three parameters: mass, angular momentum, and electric charge.\n\nResolvability of Different Harmonic Modes\n\nThe resolvability of different harmonic modes is crucial for testing the no-hair theorem, which states that a black hole spacetime in general relativity is uniquely defined by at most three parameters: mass, angular momentum, and electric charge. To perform a no-hair theorem test, one needs to measure at least three QNM parameters, which can be achieved by measuring the fundamental \n𝑙\n=\n𝑚\n=\n2\nl=m=2 mode along with either another angular mode or the first overtone of the \n𝑙\n=\n𝑚\n=\n2\nl=m=2 mode. According to various studies, the minimum SNR needed to resolve different harmonic modes varies, for example, \n𝜌\n220\n,\n330\n∼\n5.6\nρ\n220,330\n\t​\n\n∼5.6 for resolving the frequencies of the \n(\n2\n,\n2\n,\n0\n)\n(2,2,0) and \n(\n3\n,\n3\n,\n0\n)\n(3,3,0) modes, and \n𝜌\n220\n,\n221\n∼\n91\nρ\n220,221\n\t​\n\n∼91 for resolving the damping times of the \n(\n2\n,\n2\n,\n0\n)\n(2,2,0) and \n(\n2\n,\n2\n,\n1\n)\n(2,2,1) modes.\n\nRayleigh Resolvability Criterion\n\nThe Rayleigh resolvability criterion is used to determine if a mode is resolvable, which means that the peak of the estimators of QNM frequencies should be separated by at least the largest of their variances. A mode is considered detectable if its SNR is greater than \n5\n5 and resolvable if it satisfies the Rayleigh resolvability criterion. This criterion is an extension of the Rayleigh condition for diffraction.\n\nMinimum Signal-to-Noise Ratio for Resolving Harmonic Modes\n\nThe minimum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) required to resolve different harmonic modes in LIGO's spectroscopy horizon according to the Rayleigh condition has been studied by various experts in the field. For resolving the frequencies of the \n(\n2\n,\n2\n,\n0\n)\n(2,2,0) and \n(\n3\n,\n3\n,\n0\n)\n(3,3,0) modes, the minimum SNR needed is \n𝜌\n220\n,\n330\n∼\n5.6\nρ\n220,330\n\t​\n\n∼5.6. In contrast, to resolve the \n(\n2\n,\n2\n,\n0\n)\n(2,2,0) and \n(\n2\n,\n2\n,\n1\n)\n(2,2,1) modes, the SNR required is \n𝜌\n220\n,\n221\n&\n55\nρ\n220,221\n\t​\n\n&55, while for the \n(\n2\n,\n2\n,\n0\n)\n(2,2,0) and \n(\n3\n,\n3\n,\n0\n)\n(3,3,0) modes, \n𝜌\n220\n,\n330\n&\n780\nρ\n220,330\n\t​\n\n&780. Additionally, for resolving the damping times of the \n(\n2\n,\n2\n,\n0\n)\n(2,2,0) and \n(\n2\n,\n2\n,\n1\n)\n(2,2,1) modes, the minimum SNR needed is approximately \n𝜌\n220\n,\n221\n∼\n91\nρ\n220,221\n\t​\n\n∼91. A study discussing the minimum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) required to resolve different harmonic modes in LIGO's spectroscopy horizon according to the Rayleigh condition found that the SNR needed to resolve the \n(\n2\n,\n2\n,\n0\n)\n(2,2,0) and \n(\n2\n,\n2\n,\n1\n)\n(2,2,1) modes is \n𝜌\n>\n10\nρ>10, whereas for the \n(\n2\n,\n2\n,\n0\n)\n(2,2,0) and \n(\n3\n,\n3\n,\n0\n)\n(3,3,0) modes, it is required that \n𝜌\n>\n13.5\nρ>13.5; these results are based on an analysis utilizing the Rayleigh criterion. The minimum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) required to resolve different harmonic modes is approximately \n𝑆\n𝑁\n𝑅\n≈\n100\nSNR≈100, as previously reported in work citing the need for high SNR to meet the Rayleigh conditions.\n\nRelationship Between Rayleigh Condition and No-Hair Theorem Test\n\nThe relationship between the Rayleigh condition and the no-hair theorem test in the context of LIGO's spectroscopy horizon involves the resolvability of two modes, as stated by the Rayleigh criterion, which requires \n𝜏\n220\n∼\n𝜏\nℓ\n𝑚\n0\nτ\n220\n\t​\n\n∼τ\nℓm0\n\t​\n\n and \n𝑓\n220\n∼\n𝑓\n221\nf\n220\n\t​\n\n∼f\n221\n\t​\n\n. The Rayleigh criterion is used to assess the detectability of the first overtone, and it is considered too restrictive to assess detectability.

Neutron stars form in the mass range of 1 to 2 solar masses, while the first mass gap occurs between 2 and 5 solar masses due to the absence of compact objects from rapid supernova explosions. The formation of black holes occurs in the mass range of 5 to 50 solar masses, with a second mass gap between 50 and 135 solar masses created by pair-instability supernovae. Additionally, black holes with masses up to 135 solar masses may potentially form, limited by the initial mass function and the strength of stellar winds. The inclusion of pair-instability pulsation supernovae in standard evolutionary models is consistent with LIGO observations of black hole mergers, such as GW150914 and GW151226.", "gpt4o_mini_answer": "Pair-instability pulsation supernovae (PPSNe) are a fascinating phenomenon that occurs in very massive stars, typically in the mass range of about 60 to 130 solar masses. These stars undergo a series of pulsations due to the formation of electron-positron pairs in their cores, which leads to significant mass loss through powerful stellar winds and ultimately results in a supernova explosion.\n\nThe significance of mass loss associated with PPSNe in relation to black hole formation is profound. When a massive star undergoes a PPSNe, it can lose a substantial fraction of its mass before the final collapse. This mass loss alters the final mass of the remnant core that can potentially collapse into a black hole. \n\n### Key Points on Mass Loss and Black Hole Formation:\n\n1. **Mass Loss Mechanism**: During the pulsation phases, the star can lose a significant amount of its outer layers. This mass loss can be on the order of several tens of solar masses, depending on the initial mass and the specifics of the pulsation and explosion dynamics.\n\n2. **Impact on Black Hole Mass**: The mass of the black hole that forms after the supernova is directly influenced by the amount of mass lost during the PPSNe. If a star loses a significant portion of its mass, the remnant core that collapses into a black hole will be less massive than it would have been without the mass loss. \n\n3. **Predicted Mass Ranges**: The mass range of black holes formed from PPSNe is expected to be lower than that of black holes formed from direct collapse of massive stars (which can retain more of their mass). This means that the black holes resulting from PPSNe are likely to have masses in the range of about 20 to 50 solar masses, rather than the higher mass ranges that might be expected from stars that do not experience significant mass loss.\n\n4. **Implications for Population Studies**: The mass loss from PPSNe affects the overall population of black holes in the universe. It suggests that there may be a scarcity of black holes in certain mass ranges (particularly the very massive ones) because many of the progenitor stars would have lost enough mass to prevent the formation of black holes above a certain mass threshold.\n\n5. **Astrophysical Observations**: Understanding the mass loss from PPSNe is crucial for interpreting observations of black holes and their formation channels. It helps in modeling the expected distributions of black hole masses and can influence our understanding of gravitational wave events, as merging black holes may originate from different evolutionary paths.\n\nIn summary, the mass loss associated with pair-instability pulsation supernovae plays a critical role in determining the mass of the black holes that can form from these massive stars. It leads to a lower predicted mass range for these black holes and has significant implications for our understanding of stellar evolution, black hole demographics, and the dynamics of the universe.", "gpt4o_mini_score": 9, "marvel_standard_answer": "The mass loss associated with pair-instability pulsation supernovae (PISN) significantly affects the formation of black holes by reducing the progenitor star's mass, thereby influencing the predicted mass ranges for these black holes.

The mass loss due to PISNe limits the Population I/II stellar-origin black-hole mass to \n50\n𝑀\n⊙\n50M\n⊙\n\t​\n\n, in tension with earlier predictions that the maximum black-hole mass could be as high as \n100\n𝑀\n⊙\n100M\n⊙\n\t​\n\n [1,2]. This process affects the formation of black holes, particularly in the mass range of \n50\n–\n140\n𝑀\n⊙\n50–140M\n⊙\n\t​\n\n [3]. The mass loss associated with PISNe leads to a \"mass gap\" in black hole masses between \n2\n−\n5\n𝑀\n⊙\n2−5M\n⊙\n\t​\n\n due to rapid supernova explosions [4]. It also results in a predicted mass range for black holes of \n5\n−\n50\n𝑀\n⊙\n5−50M\n⊙\n\t​\n\n, with neutron stars forming with masses \n1\n−\n2\n𝑀\n⊙\n1−2M\n⊙\n\t​\n\n [4]. Additionally, the suppression of double black-hole-merger rates by PISNe is negligible for the evolutionary channel considered [5,6]. The predicted mass ranges for black holes vary depending on the study: * \n24\n–\n46\n𝑀\n⊙\n24–46M\n⊙\n\t​\n\n [9]. * \n30\n–\n40\n𝑀\n⊙\n30–40M\n⊙\n\t​\n\n [7]. * \n46\n−\n93\n𝑀\n⊙\n46−93M\n⊙\n\t​\n\n [10]. The mass loss associated with PISNe also affects the merger rates of black holes. Research suggests that the suppression of double black hole merger rates by PISNe is negligible for their evolutionary channel [5]. However, PISNe can lead to additional electromagnetic transients and result in long-lived phases of Roche-lobe overflow or even common-envelope events if there is a close binary companion [12]. In conclusion, the mass loss associated with pair-instability pulsation supernovae plays a crucial role in shaping the black hole mass function, particularly in creating a sharp peak referred to as the upper black hole mass gap. The predicted mass ranges for black holes are significantly affected by this mass loss, with implications for the detection of binary black hole mergers.\n\nReferences\n\n[1] https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2016/10/aa28980-16/aa28980-16.html [2] http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016A&A...594A..97B/abstract [3] https://www.raa-journal.org/issues/all/2023/v23n1/202301/P020230209404124604523.pdf [4] https://arxiv.org/html/2312.13459v1 [5] https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/abf2c4.pdf [6] https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/512/3/4503/6552975 [7] https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ab3981.pdf [8] https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/512/3/4503/6552975 [9] https://aasnova.org/2021/08/20/addressing-a-gap-in-our-knowledge-of-black-holes/ [10] https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04654 [11] https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.03116 [12] https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.13412 </TASK_OUTPUT>\n\nREFERENCES\n\n<TASK_OUTPUT>\n\nhttps://hal.science/hal-04076314v1/file/stad2443.pdf\nhttps://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2016/10/aa28980-16/aa28980-16.html\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair-instability_supernova\nhttps://arxiv.org/html/2312.13459v1\nhttps://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/abf2c4.pdf\nhttps://www.raa-journal.org/issues/all/2023/v23n1/202301/P020230209404124604523.pdf\nhttps://www.ipmu.jp/en/20200625-PPISN\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/305228759_The_Effect_of_Pair-Instability_Mass_Loss_on_Black_Hole_Mergers\nhttps://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ab3981.pdf\nhttps://aasnova.org/2021/08/20/addressing-a-gap-in-our-knowledge-of-black-holes\nhttps://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/512/3/4503/6552975\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1607.03116\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04654\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1810.13412\nhttps://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/pdf/2016/10/aa28980-16.pdf\nhttps://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/534/1/151/7746769\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.109.103021\nhttp://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016A&A...594A..97B/abstract\nhttps://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/526/3/4130/7277572\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/395419027_Binary_Black_Hole_Phase_Space_Discovers_the_Signature_of_Pair_Instability_Supernovae_Mass_Gap\nhttps://arxiv.org/html/2509.04151v1\nhttps://arxiv.org/html/2509.09123v1\nhttps://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8572\nhttps://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/pdf/2024/12/aa52356-24.pdf\nhttps://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2017/03/aa30401-17/aa30401-17.html\nhttps://wwwmpa.mpa-garching.mpg.de/conf/psrc/talks/Leung.pdf\nhttps://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/45526/how-does-pair-production-cause-a-pair-instability-supernova-instead-of-leading-t\nhttps://arxiv.org/html/2505.07959v2\nhttps://arxiv.org/html/2507.21307v1\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/371939443_Very_Massive_Stars_and_Pair-Instability_Supernovae_Mass-loss_Framework_for_low_Metallicity\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.109.103021.pdf\nhttps://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2016/10/aa28980-16/aa28980-16.html\nhttps://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2017/03/aa30401-17/aa30401-17.html\nhttps://www.ucolick.org/~woosley/ay220-15/lectures/lecture18.4x.pdf\nhttps://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adf4e7.pdf\nhttps://wwwmpa.mpa-garching.mpg.de/conf/psrc/talks/Leung.pdf\nhttps://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/45526/how-does-pair-production-cause-a-pair-instability-supernova-instead-of-leading-t\nhttps://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/abf2c4.pdf\nhttps://arxiv.org/html/2505.07959v2\nhttps://arxiv.org/html/2507.21307v1\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/371939443_Very_Massive_Stars_and_Pair-Instability_Supernovae_Mass-loss_Framework_for_low_Metallicity\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.109.103021.pdf\nhttps://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/534/1/151/7746769\nhttps://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ab3981.pdf\nhttps://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/512/3/4503/6552975\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1607.03116\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1810.13412\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/305228759_The_Effect_of_Pair-Instability_Mass_Loss_on_Black_Hole_Mergers\nhttps://inspirehep.net/literature/1701234\nhttps://arxiv.org/html/2509.04637v1\nhttps://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/526/3/4130/7277572\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.109.103021.pdf\nhttps://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/abf2c4.pdf </TASK_OUTPUT>", "marvel_deepsearch_score": 8, "evaluation_model_type": "openai", "evaluation_model_name": "gpt-4o-mini", "qa_model_type": "openai", "qa_model_name": "gpt-4o-mini", "gpt4o_mini_answer_relevancy": 0.98, "gpt4o_mini_answer_correctness": 0.87, "gpt4o_mini_faithfulness": 0.92, "marvel_standard_answer_relevancy": 0.92, "marvel_standard_answer_correctness": 0.7, "marvel_standard_faithfulness": 0.85, "marvel_deepsearch_answer_relevancy": 0.95, "marvel_deepsearch_answer_correctness": 0.92, "marvel_deepsearch_faithfulness": 0.98}

In the context of signal detection, this means that the estimates of the signal parameters become more accurate, leading to better decision-making.\n\n2. **Central Limit Theorem**: For large sample sizes, the distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution, regardless of the original distribution of the data. This property allows for more reliable statistical inference and reduces the uncertainty in the estimation of the signal.\n\n3. **Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)**: When the signal is sufficiently strong, the SNR is high. A high SNR means that the signal is much more distinguishable from the noise. As the sample size increases, the effects of noise become less significant relative to the signal, further reducing the error probability.\n\n4. **Error Probability and Decision Boundaries**: In a Gaussian model, the decision boundaries for detecting the signal can be optimized as more data becomes available.

This is supported by multiple sources, including a detailed explanation on ScienceDirect, which discusses how increasing the sample size \n𝑛\nn decreases the variance of the sample mean, thereby improving the accuracy of decisions and decreasing error probability.\n\nEffect of Sample Size on Error Probability in Gaussian Signal-Noise Models\n\n====================================================================================\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe relationship between sample size and error probability in Gaussian signal-noise models is a crucial concept in statistical hypothesis testing and signal processing. In this article, we will explore how increasing the sample size affects the error probability in Gaussian signal-noise models, particularly when the signal is sufficiently strong.\n\nSample Size and Error Probability\n\nIn a Gaussian signal-noise model, increasing the sample size leads to a reduction in noise and an improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio when the signals correlate and the noise doesn't [1]. According to the Cramer-Rao bound, more information should always reduce the variance, and statistically, the noise probabilities will be so low that there will be a high degree of confidence that whatever is inferred is likely to be accurate [2].\n\nMathematical Framework\n\nMathematically, as the sample size \n𝑛\nn increases, the variance of the sample mean decreases, which improves the accuracy of decisions [3]. This is because the sample mean is itself Gaussian distributed with a variance that reduces. The law of large numbers also guarantees that the error becomes zero as \n𝑛\nn approaches infinity [4].\n\nSignal-to-Noise Ratio Improvement\n\nThe improvement in signal-to-noise ratio is expected to be by a factor of \n𝑁\nN\n\t​\n\n with the number of data sets [2]. This is because, in a Gaussian signal-noise model, increasing the sample size by having \n𝑁\nN data sets that measure the same quantity as a function of time leads to a reduction in noise.\n\nEffect of Strong Signal\n\nWhen the signal is sufficiently strong, the error probability decreases as the sample size increases [3]. This is because the sample mean is Gaussian distributed with a variance that reduces, leading to more accurate decisions.\n\nQuantitative Relationship\n\nThe quantitative relationship between sample size and error probability decrease in a Gaussian signal noise model with a sufficiently strong signal can be described as an exponential decrease in error probability with an increase in sample size. Specifically, the error probability \n𝑃\n𝑒\nP\ne\n\t​\n\n is proportional to \n𝑒\n−\n𝑛\n𝐸\ne\n−nE\n, where \n𝑛\nn is the sample size and \n𝐸\nE is the error-exponent. The error-exponent \n𝐸\nE or \n𝐾\nK can be a function of the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), \n𝛾\n=\n𝜎\n𝑠\n2\n𝜎\n𝑛\n2\nγ=\nσ\nn\n2\n\t​\n\nσ\ns\n2\n\t​\n\n\t​\n\n, and for a Gauss-Markov signal, it can be expressed as \n𝐾\n=\n1\n2\nlog\n⁡\n(\n1\n+\n𝜎\n𝑠\n2\n𝜎\n𝑤\n2\n)\n1\n1\n−\n𝜌\n2\nK=\n2\n1\n\t​\n\nlog(1+\nσ\nw\n2\n\t​\n\nσ\ns\n2\n\t​\n\n\t​\n\n)\n1−ρ\n2\n1\n\t​\n\n, where \n𝜎\n𝑠\n2\nσ\ns\n2\n\t​\n\n and \n𝜎\n𝑤\n2\nσ\nw\n2\n\t​\n\n are the variances of the signal and noise, respectively, and \n𝜌\nρ is the correlation coefficient of the signal.\n\nAdditional Information on Signal-to-Noise Ratio\n\nThe signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) change in a Gaussian signal noise model with a sufficiently strong signal as the sample size increases can be understood through higher-order asymptotics in the SNR-aware minimax framework. The minimax risk \n𝑅\n(\nΘ\n(\n𝑘\n𝑛\n,\n𝜏\n𝑛\n)\n,\n𝜎\n𝑛\n)\nR(Θ(k\nn\n\t​\n\n,τ\nn\n\t​\n\n),σ\nn\n\t​\n\n) behaves like \n𝜎\n𝑛\n2\n𝑛\n𝜖\n𝑛\n𝜇\n𝑛\n−\n2\nσ\nn\n2\n\t​\n\nnϵ\nn\n\t​\n\nμ\nn\n−2\n\t​\n\n for \n𝜇\n𝑛\n→\n0\nμ\nn\n\t​\n\n→0, \n𝜖\n𝑛\n→\n0\nϵ\nn\n\t​\n\n→0, indicating that SNR improves as sample size \n𝑛\nn increases, particularly with a sufficiently strong signal.\n\nSNR Estimation in Linear Systems\n\nIn linear systems with Gaussian matrices, the SNR estimation can be considered using tools from random matrix theory (RMT) [1]. The system is represented as \n𝑦\n=\n𝑊\n𝑥\n𝑜\n+\n𝑛\ny=Wx\no\n\t​\n\n+n, where \n𝑊\nW is an \n𝑀\n×\n𝐾\nM×K Gaussian matrix with centered unit variance i.i.d. entries. A new SNR estimation technique is proposed using RMT, which provides high SNR estimation accuracy for different scenarios and maintains its high accuracy even for small matrix dimensions.\n\nHigher-Order Asymptotics in SNR-Aware Minimax Framework\n\nThe SNR change in a Gaussian signal noise model with a sufficiently strong signal as the sample size increases can be understood through the lens of higher-order asymptotics in the SNR-aware minimax framework [2]. This framework focuses on the Gaussian sequence model \n𝑦\n𝑖\n=\n𝜃\n𝑖\n+\n𝜎\n𝑛\n𝑧\n𝑖\ny\ni\n\t​\n\n=θ\ni\n\t​\n\n+σ\nn\n\t​\n\nz\ni\n\t​\n\n, \n𝑖\n=\n1\n,\n2\n,\n…\n,\n𝑛\ni=1,2,…,n, where \n𝑦\n=\n(\n𝑦\n1\n,\n…\n,\n𝑦\n𝑛\n)\ny=(y\n1\n\t​\n\n,…,y\nn\n\t​\n\n) is the vector of observations, \n𝜃\n=\n(\n𝜃\n1\n,\n…\n,\n𝜃\n𝑛\n)\nθ=(θ\n1\n\t​\n\n,…,θ\nn\n\t​\n\n) is the unknown signal, \n𝑧\n𝑖\nz\ni\n\t​\n\n's are i.i.d. standard Gaussian error variables, and \n𝜎\n𝑛\n>\n0\nσ\nn\n\t​\n\n>0 is the noise level. The goal is to estimate \n𝜃\nθ from a sparse parameter space \nΘ\n(\n𝑘\n𝑛\n)\n=\n{\n𝜃\n∈\n𝑅\n𝑛\n:\n∥\n𝜃\n∥\n0\n≤\n𝑘\n𝑛\n}\nΘ(k\nn\n\t​\n\n)={θ∈R\nn\n:∥θ∥\n0\n\t​\n\n≤k\nn\n\t​\n\n}.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, increasing the sample size in a Gaussian signal-noise model leads to a decrease in error probability, particularly when the signal is sufficiently strong. This is due to the reduction in noise, improvement in signal-to-noise ratio, and decrease in variance of the sample mean.\n\nReferences\n[1] https://www.physicsforums.com/threads/effect-of-a-moving-average-on-gaussian-noise.881479/\n[2] https://www.physicsforums.com/threads/effect-of-a-moving-average-on-gaussian-noise.881479/\n[3] https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002224962100033X\n[4] https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/dsp-book/dsp_book_Ch2.pdf\n[5] https://api.semanticscholar.org/arXiv:cs/0507018\n[6] http://acsp.ece.cornell.edu/papers/SungTongPoor06IT.pdf\n[7] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_white_Gaussian_noise\n[8] https://chabefer.github.io/STCI/FPSI.html\n[9] https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.01466\n[10] https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.05954\n[11] https://www.mathworks.com/help/phased/ug/signal-detection-in-white-gaussian-noise.html\n[12] https://scispace.com/pdf/signal-to-noise-ratio-is-more-important-than-sampling-rate-5ans8v2s.pdf", "marvel_deepsearch_score": 9, "evaluation_model_type": "openai", "evaluation_model_name": "gpt-4o-mini", "qa_model_type": "openai", "qa_model_name": "gpt-4o-mini", "gpt4o_mini_answer_relevancy": 0.95, "gpt4o_mini_answer_correctness": 0.95, "gpt4o_mini_faithfulness": 0.7, "marvel_standard_answer_relevancy": 0.95, "marvel_standard_answer_correctness": 0.95, "marvel_standard_faithfulness": 0.95, "marvel_deepsearch_answer_relevancy": 0.98, "marvel_deepsearch_answer_correctness": 0.9, "marvel_deepsearch_faithfulness": 0.98}

Future continuous gravitational wave detections are expected to provide further insights into neutron star characteristics [@\"url:https://www.azoquantum.com/News.aspx?newsID=10464\",\"url:https://www.azoquantum.com/News.aspx?gt%3B=&newsID=10464>\"]. </TASK_OUTPUT>\n\nSUMMARY\n\n<TASK_OUTPUT> The significant advancements in gravitational wave astronomy last year include the detection of black hole-black hole and neutron star-neutron star mergers. These detections have confirmed predictions made by Einstein's theory of general relativity and have provided new insights into the properties of black holes and neutron stars.\n\nRecent updates on black hole-neutron star mergers include the detection of two collisions between a black hole and a neutron star, occurring just 10 days apart in January 2020. The mergers involved black holes of 9 and 6 solar masses and neutron stars of 1.9 and 1.5 solar masses, respectively.\n\nThe merger rate calculated using these two signals suggests that for every 10 neutron star binaries, there is approximately one NSBH merger. The properties of the compact objects, including the estimated masses and merger times, will help astronomers and modelers understand the formation and evolution of NSBHs.\n\nRecent estimates of the merger rate density of black hole-neutron star binaries have provided valuable insights into the properties of these systems. A study by BJ Tsao in 2024 discussed the evolution of merger rate density estimates over the past year, particularly in light of new detections and updated analysis techniques. The study reported a merger rate density estimate of approximately 1.2 per unit volume per unit time.\n\nThe LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration has confirmed the detection of two collisions between a black hole and a neutron star, occurring just 10 days apart in January 2020, with the gravitational waves rippling across at least 900 million light-years to reach Earth. The first merger, detected on January 5, 2020, involved a black hole of 9 solar masses and a 1.9-solar-mass neutron star, while the second merger, detected on January 15, involved a 6-solar-mass black hole and a 1.5-solar-mass neutron star.\n\nThese detections are the first confident detections of gravitational waves from black holes merging with neutron stars. With these detections, researchers now have measurements of the rates across all 3 categories of compact binary mergers. The mergers likely resulted in the neutron stars being swallowed whole by their black hole partners. Researchers estimate that, within one billion light-years of Earth, roughly one such merger happens per month.\n\nThe LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration has reported updates on the rates and properties of black hole-neutron star mergers, inferring a merger rate of \n4\n4\n−\n37\n+\n102\n \nG\np\nc\n−\n3\ny\nr\n−\n1\n44\n−37\n+102\n\t​\n\nGpc\n−3\nyr\n−1\n when considering the fully precessing parameter space. This rate is \n16\n%\n16% lower than that estimated with tools currently adopted by the LVK. The change in the NSBH merger rate is approximately linear in the effective perpendicular spin.\n\nReferences\nhttps://www.ligo.caltech.edu/news/ligo20210629\nhttps://www.nsf.gov/news/astrophysicists-detect-first-black-hole-neutron\nhttps://www.ligo.caltech.edu/news/ligo20240405\nhttps://arstechnica.com/science/2025/09/new-black-hole-merger-bolsters-hawking-area-theorem\nhttps://www.icds.psu.edu/elusive-mergers-of-black-holes-with-neutron-stars-confirmed-for-first-time\nhttps://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021nova.pres.8073K/abstract\nhttps://pnp.ligo.org/ppcomm/Papers.html\nhttps://arxiv.org/html/2503.09773v1\nhttps://www.caltech.edu/about/news/ten-years-later-ligo-is-a-black-hole-hunting-machine\nhttps://physics.mit.edu/news/ten-years-later-ligo-is-a-black-hole-hunting-machine/\nhttps://www.mpg.de/25343549/clearest-gravitational-wave-signal\nhttps://news.mit.edu/2021/merger-black-holes-neutron-stars-0629\nhttps://arxiv.org/html/2405.06819v2\nhttps://www.ligo.caltech.edu/news/ligo20250826\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.111.043020\nhttps://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2024/03/aa47971-23/aa47971-23.html\nhttps://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6382/ad7c12\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-024-02338-0\nhttps://arxiv.org/html/2505.19962v1\nhttps://arxiv.org/html/2508.06020v2\nhttps://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevX.13.011048.pdf\nhttps://quantumzeitgeist.com/researchers-find-stronger-black-hole-evolution-with-marginal-events\nhttps://dcc.ligo.org/LIGO-P2400354/public\nhttps://www.janss.kr/download/download_pdf?gt%3B=&pid=jass-41-3-149&quot%3B=\nhttps://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2021/06/astrophysicists-detect-first-black-hole-neutron-star-mergers-gravitational-waves\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s42254-021-00303-8\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s42254-021-00303-8&gt\nhttps://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/abb6ea.pdf\nhttps://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/abb6ea&gt\nhttps://www.caltech.edu/about/news/ten-years-later-ligo-is-a-black-hole-hunting-machine&gt\nhttps://www.mpg.de/25343549/clearest-gravitational-wave-signal\nhttps://www.mpg.de/25343549/clearest-gravitational-wave-signal&gt\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2025/07/16/science/massive-black-hole-collision-gravitational-waves\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2025/07/16/science/massive-black-hole-collision-gravitational-waves&gt\nhttps://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2025/09/gravitational-wave-detection-verifies-stephen-hawkings-theorem\nhttps://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2025/09/gravitational-wave-detection-verifies-stephen-hawkings-theorem&gt\nhttps://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013nsf....1307545R/abstract\nhttps://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013nsf....1307545R/abstract&gt\nhttps://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/h6rl-mcjm\nhttps://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/h6rl-mcjm&gt\nhttps://www.simonsfoundation.org/2025/07/21/gravitational-waves-reveal-most-massive-black-hole-merger-ever-detected\nhttps://www.simonsfoundation.org/2025/07/21/gravitational-waves-reveal-most-massive-black-hole-merger-ever-detected/&gt\nhttps://www.psu.edu/news/eberly-college-science/story/black-holes-everywhere-ten-years-ligo-and-gravitational-waves\nhttps://www.psu.edu/news/eberly-college-science/story/black-holes-everywhere-ten-years-ligo-and-gravitational-waves&gt\nhttps://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/521/2/2103/7028784\nhttps://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/521/2/2103/7028784&gt\nhttps://www.azoquantum.com/News.aspx?newsID=10464\nhttps://www.azoquantum.com/News.aspx?gt%3B=&newsID=10464&quot%3B=\nhttps://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/542/2/1172/8221863\nhttps://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/542/2/1172/8221863&gt\nhttps://arxiv.org/html/2508.08750v2\nhttps://arxiv.org/html/2508.08750v2&gt\nhttps://www.mpg.de/21778967/0404-grav-mysterious-object-in-the-gap-152520-x\nhttps://www.mpg.de/21778967/0404-grav-mysterious-object-in-the-gap-152520-x&gt\nhttps://www.nsf.gov/news/astrophysicists-detect-first-black-hole-neutron\nhttps://www.nsf.gov/news/astrophysicists-detect-first-black-hole-neutron&gt\nhttps://par.nsf.gov/biblio/10615465-black-holeneutron-star-binary-mergers-impact-stellar-compactness\nhttps://par.nsf.gov/biblio/10615465-black-holeneutron-star-binary-mergers-impact-stellar-compactness&gt\nhttps://science.psu.edu/news/LIGO06-2021\nhttps://science.psu.edu/news/LIGO06-2021&gt\nhttps://www.frontiersin.org/journals/astronomy-and-space-sciences/articles/10.3389/fspas.2020.00046/full&gt\nhttps://ciera.northwestern.edu/2021/06/29/astrophysicists-detect-first-black-hole-neutron-star-mergers\nhttps://ciera.northwestern.edu/2021/06/29/astrophysicists-detect-first-black-hole-neutron-star-mergers/&gt\nhttps://www.psu.edu/news/research/story/elusive-mergers-black-holes-neutron-stars-confirmed-first-time\nhttps://www.psu.edu/news/research/story/elusive-mergers-black-holes-neutron-stars-confirmed-first-time&gt\nhttps://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ac3cbf.pdf\nhttps://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ac3cbf&gt\nhttps://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adg3005\nhttps://www.science.or

Here’s an overview of the main components:\n\n### Key Factors\n\n1. **Signal Characteristics**:\n   - **Waveform Models**: The gravitational waves emitted during the inspiral phase of binary systems (like black holes or neutron stars) have specific waveform signatures that depend on the masses and spins of the components. Accurate models (e.g., post-Newtonian approximations, numerical relativity simulations) are crucial for detection.\n   - **Frequency Range**: Ground-based detectors like LIGO and Virgo are sensitive to frequencies typically between 10 Hz and a few kHz, where the inspiral signals are strongest.\n\n2. **Detector Sensitivity**:\n   - **Interferometer Design**: The design of the detectors (e.g., LIGO's Michelson interferometer) and their sensitivity to strain (changes in length due to passing gravitational waves) are critical. Sensitivity is influenced by factors like mirror quality, laser power, and seismic isolation.\n   - **Noise Sources**: Understanding and characterizing noise sources (seismic, thermal, quantum, and instrumental noise) is essential for optimizing the sensitivity of the detectors.\n\n3. **Sky Localization**:\n   - **Network of Detectors**: Using multiple detectors (e.g., LIGO in the US and Virgo in Europe) allows for triangulation of the source location, improving sky localization and enabling follow-up observations in electromagnetic wavelengths.\n\n4. **Data Quality**:\n   - **Data Conditioning**: Pre-processing of raw data to remove instrumental artifacts and noise is necessary to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the detected signals.\n\n### Methodologies\n\n1. **Matched Filtering**:\n   - **Template Bank**: A bank of theoretical waveform templates is generated based on expected signal characteristics. The matched filtering technique involves cross-correlating the detector data with these templates to identify potential signals.\n   - **SNR Calculation**: The SNR is calculated for each template, and signals with SNR above a certain threshold are flagged as potential detections.\n\n2. **Bayesian Inference**:\n   - **Parameter Estimation**: Bayesian methods are used to estimate the parameters of the binary system (masses, spins, distance, etc.) from the detected signals. This involves calculating the posterior probability distributions based on the observed data and prior knowledge.\n\n3. **Real-time Analysis**:\n   - **Online Detection**: Algorithms are implemented to analyze data in real-time, allowing for rapid identification of potential events and triggering alerts for follow-up observations.\n\n4. **Post-processing**:\n   - **Offline Analysis**: After initial detection, further analysis is performed to refine parameter estimates, assess the significance of the detection, and search for additional signals in the data.\n\n5. **Machine Learning**:\n   - **Anomaly Detection**: Machine learning techniques are increasingly being used to improve the detection of signals, classify events, and distinguish between astrophysical signals and noise.\n\n6. **Multi-messenger Astronomy**:\n   - **Follow-up Observations**: Once a gravitational wave event is detected, alerts are sent to electromagnetic observatories and neutrino detectors to search for associated signals, enhancing the understanding of the event.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe detection of gravitational wave inspiral signals from compact binary coalescence events is a complex interplay of advanced physics, engineering, and data analysis techniques. Continuous improvements in detector technology, waveform modeling, and data analysis methodologies are essential for enhancing the sensitivity and accuracy of gravitational wave astronomy.", "gpt4o_mini_score": 9, "marvel_standard_answer": "\n1.

Compact binary systems with neutron stars or black holes are one of the most promising sources for ground-based gravitational-wave detectors.\n\nKey Factors and Methodologies\n\nThe key factors and methodologies involved in detecting gravitational wave inspiral signals from compact binary coalescence events using ground-based detectors include characterizing the signal's basic features, such as its inspiral-merger-ringdown structure, polarization, chirp pattern, and signal-to-noise ratio. The inspiral phase is described by the post-Newtonian expansion, with the chirp mass \n𝑀\n𝑐\n=\n(\n𝑚\n1\n𝑚\n2\n)\n3\n/\n5\n/\n(\n𝑚\n1\n+\n𝑚\n2\n)\n1\n/\n5\nM\nc\n\t​\n\n=(m\n1\n\t​\n\nm\n2\n\t​\n\n)\n3/5\n/(m\n1\n\t​\n\n+m\n2\n\t​\n\n)\n1/5\n being a well-measured parameter.\n\nThe detection of gravitational waves from compact binary coalescence is performed using a network of ground-based gravitational-wave detectors, including LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA, which operate jointly to observe the Universe. The detectors measure a relative displacement of the interferometers' arm lengths of \n10\n−\n18\n10\n−18\n m or smaller, and the current generation of detectors, named Advanced LIGO, Advanced Virgo, and KAGRA, include features to enhance their sensitivity, such as Fabry-Perot cavities, stabilized high-power lasers, and signal recycling.\n\nDetection Techniques\n\nThe matched filtering technique is used to search for gravitational wave signals of a known form in the data taken by ground-based detectors. The template bank is constructed using a set of parameters that describe the inspiral, such as the masses \n𝑚\n1\nm\n1\n\t​\n\n and \n𝑚\n2\nm\n2\n\t​\n\n, the spin vectors \n𝑆\n𝑖\nS\ni\n\t​\n\n, and the orbital angular momentum \n𝐿\nL.\n\nParameter Estimation\n\nThe detection of inspiral signals involves the estimation of compact-binary coalescence rates, which depend on several assumptions and unknown model parameters, and are still uncertain. The likely detection rate for binary neutron-star events for the Advanced LIGO-Virgo network increases to \n40\n40 events per year, with a range between \n0.4\n0.4 and \n400\n400 per year.\n\nMethodologies for Detection\n\nThe methodologies for detecting inspiral signals include Bayesian inference methods for estimating source parameters, such as individual masses and spins, sky position, luminosity distance, polarization and inclination angles, and time and phase of coalescence. The data recorded at each observatory are transferred within a few seconds latency to computing centers for coherent analysis, and several pipelines are searching for compact binary coalescence, as well as any coherent short-duration transient signals.\n\nKey Factors\nCharacterization of Signal Features: Understanding the inspiral-merger-ringdown structure, polarization, chirp pattern, and signal-to-noise ratio.\nBayesian Inference: Used for parameter estimation, exploring a multi-dimensional space.\nIntrinsic and Extrinsic Parameters: Intrinsic parameters include masses, spins, eccentricity, and tidal deformability.

The latest density-dependent relativistic mean-field (DDRMF) parameterizations provide a framework for modeling these states. Here are some key characteristics of the EOS for symmetric nuclear matter and pure neutron matter as determined by these parameterizations:\n\n### Symmetric Nuclear Matter (SNM)\n\n1. **Density Dependence**: The EOS for symmetric nuclear matter typically exhibits a softening at high densities due to the repulsive interactions among nucleons. The saturation density (around 0.16 fm⁻³) is a critical point where the energy per nucleon is minimized.\n\n2. **Energy Per Nucleon**: The energy per nucleon in symmetric nuclear matter is often modeled as a polynomial function of density, with contributions from both kinetic and potential energy. The binding energy at saturation is approximately -16 MeV.\n\n3. **Pressure and Compressibility**: The pressure of symmetric nuclear matter increases with density, reflecting the strong repulsive forces at high densities. The incompressibility coefficient (K) is an important parameter, typically ranging from 200 to 300 MeV, indicating how much the matter resists compression.\n\n4. **Symmetry Energy**: The symmetry energy, which quantifies the energy cost of converting symmetric nuclear matter into pure neutron matter, is a critical aspect of the EOS. It is often modeled as a function of density and is essential for understanding neutron-rich systems.\n\n### Pure Neutron Matter (PNM)\n\n1. **Neutron-rich Environment**: The EOS for pure neutron matter is characterized by a lack of protons, leading to different interactions. The energy per nucleon in PNM is generally higher than in SNM due to the absence of attractive proton-neutron interactions.\n\n2. **Softening at High Densities**: Similar to SNM, the EOS for PNM shows softening at high densities, but the behavior can be more pronounced due to the strong repulsive forces among neutrons.\n\n3. **Pressure and Neutron Star Stability**: The pressure in pure neutron matter is crucial for the stability of neutron stars. The EOS must support the weight of the star against gravitational collapse, which is influenced by the high-density behavior of the EOS.\n\n4. **Neutron Matter Instabilities**: At very high densities, the EOS may exhibit instabilities, leading to phenomena such as the formation of exotic phases (e.g., pion condensation or quark matter) depending on the specific parameterization used.\n\n### General Trends and Implications\n\n- **Parameterization Variability**: Different DDRMF parameterizations can lead to variations in the predicted EOS, particularly at high densities. This variability affects predictions for neutron star properties, such as maximum mass and radius.\n\n- **Observational Constraints**: The EOS is constrained by astrophysical observations, such as gravitational wave signals from neutron star mergers and the mass-radius relationships of observed neutron stars.\n\n- **Nuclear Interactions**: The underlying nuclear interactions modeled in the DDRMF framework play a significant role in determining the characteristics of the EOS, including the balance between attractive and repulsive forces.\n\nIn summary, the EOS for symmetric nuclear matter and pure neutron matter as determined by the latest DDRMF parameterizations is characterized by density-dependent behaviors, saturation properties, and implications for neutron star physics, with significant variability depending on the specific parameterization used.", "gpt4o_mini_score": 9, "marvel_standard_answer": "<QUERY> What are the characteristics of the equation of state (EOS) for symmetric nuclear matter and pure neutron matter as determined by the latest density-dependent relativistic mean-field parameterizations?.

Recent studies have focused on determining the characteristics of the EOS using density-dependent relativistic mean-field parameterizations.\n\n## Relativistic Mean-Field Models\n\nRelativistic mean-field models (RMF) based on the exchange of $σ$, $ω$, and $ρ$ mesons, including non-linear nucleon-$σ$ couplings and density-dependent $ρ$ coupling, are widely used to describe the EOS. These models have been successful in reproducing nuclear physics knowledge encoded in terms of the nuclear empirical parameters.\n\n## Equation of State\n\nThe EOS for symmetric nuclear matter and pure neutron matter can be characterized by examining the nuclear matter parameters, particularly the energy per nucleon, which can be written as a power series: $E(nB, δ) = E0(nB) + Esym (nB)δ2 + O(δ4)$, where $δ = $\\frac{n(v)_n$ - n(v)_p}{nB}$. The energy per nucleon in symmetric nuclear matter is given by $E0(nB) = mnuc − Bsat + $\\frac{1}{2}$ Kx^2 + $\\frac{1}{6}$ Qx^3 + ...$, which depends on the total baryon density $nB = n(v)_n + n(v)_p$.\n\n## Density Dependence of Symmetry Energy\n\nThe density dependence of the symmetry energy is of particular interest for astrophysical applications. The symmetry energy, representing the energy difference between pure neutron matter and symmetric nuclear matter, is expanded up to second order as $E_{sym}(\\rho) = E_{sym0} + $L_{sym0}(\\frac{\\rho$ - \\rho_0}{3\\rho_0}) + $\\frac{1}{2}K_{sym0}(\\frac{\\rho$ - \\rho_0}{3\\rho_0})^2$, where $E_{sym0} = E_{sym}(\\rho_0)$, and $L_{sym0}$ and $K_{sym0}$ are parameters.\n\n## Constraints on EOS\n\nRecent studies have imposed constraints on the EOS using various approaches, including $χ$EFT predictions for low-density neutron matter, nuclear empirical parameters, and astrophysical observations. For example, a study published in _Physical Review C_ used density-dependent relativistic mean-field parameterizations to investigate the EOS, with a focus on symmetric nuclear matter and pure neutron matter [1]. Another study used Bayesian inference to determine the parameters that define the isovector behavior of the model, specifically $g_{\\rho}$, $g_{\\delta}$, and $g_{\\omega\\rho}$ [2].\n\n## Results\n\nThe results of these studies have provided valuable insights into the characteristics of the EOS. For instance, the optimization of pure isovector parameters of popular relativistic mean-field (RMF) and Skyrme-Hartree-Fock (SHF) nuclear energy-density functionals (EDFs) was performed using constraints on the pure neutron matter (PNM) equation of state (EoS) from recent _ab initio_ calculations [3]. The selected RMF models are compatible with present nuclear and astrophysical constraints and can be employed to make predictions and quantify their uncertainties [4].\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the characteristics of the EOS for symmetric nuclear matter and pure neutron matter have been determined by the latest density-dependent relativistic mean-field parameterizations. These studies have provided valuable insights into the density dependence of the symmetry energy, the curvature parameter of the symmetry energy, and the radius of neutron stars.\n\n## References\n\n* [1] [https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevC.98.065804](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevC.98.065804)\n* [2] [https://arxiv.org/html/2412.04946v1](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.04946v1)\n* [3] [https://arxiv.org/abs/1209.2718](https://arxiv.org/abs/1209.2718)\n* [4] [https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025arXiv250323028P/abstract](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025arXiv250323028P/abstract)", "marvel_standard_score": 6, "marvel_deepsearch_answer": "KEY_FACTS\n\n<TASK_OUTPUT>\n\nThe energy per nucleon (EoS) of pure neutron matter at a density close to \n0.7\n𝜌\n0\n0.7ρ\n0\n\t​\n\n is approximately \n11\n11 MeV [@\"url:https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/128559/1708.01521.pdf?isAllowed=y.pdf&sequence=2\"].\nThe symmetry energy \n𝐽\nJ and its slope parameter \n𝐿\nL at saturation density are within a tight range of \n𝜎\n(\n𝐽\n)\n<\n2\nσ(J)<2 MeV and \n𝜎\n(\n𝐿\n)\n<\n6\nσ(L)<6 MeV [@\"url:https://inspirehep.net/literature/1689152\"].\nThe median symmetry energy is uniform, and for different models, the median is \n∼\n32\n∼32 MeV [@\"url:https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Symmetry-energy-S-a-and-energy-per-nucleon-E-A-in-pure-neutron-matter-PNM-and_fig2_353226278\"].\nThe curvature parameter of the symmetry energy, \n𝐾\n𝑠\n𝑦\n𝑚\nK\nsym\n\t​\n\n, for symmetric nuclear matter and pure neutron matter has been constrained to be about \n𝐾\n𝑠\n𝑦\n𝑚\n≈\n−\n107\n±\n88\nK\nsym\n\t​\n\n≈−107±88 MeV at a 68% confidence level.\nThe radius of a \n1.4\n𝑀\n⊙\n1.4M\n⊙\n\t​\n\n neutron star is predicted to be between \n12.3\n12.3 and \n13.3\n𝑘\n𝑚\n13.3km.\nThe tidal deformability is constrained within \n70\n≤\nΛ\n1.4\n≤\n580\n70≤Λ\n1.4\n\t​\n\n≤580 by GW170817 observations.\nMaximum neutron star masses are predicted to be up to \n2.6\n𝑀\n⊙\n2.6M\n⊙\n\t​\n\n. </TASK_OUTPUT>\nFINER_DETAILS\n\n<TASK_OUTPUT> The characteristics of the equation of state (EOS) for symmetric nuclear matter and pure neutron matter as determined by the latest density-dependent relativistic mean-field parameterizations are:\n\nThe energy per nucleon (EoS) of pure neutron matter at a density close to \n0.7\n𝜌\n0\n0.7ρ\n0\n\t​\n\n is approximately \n11\n11 MeV [@\"url:https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.13210\",\"url:https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.13210&gt\",\"url:https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013JPhCS.420a2108F/abstract\",\"url:https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013JPhCS.420a2108F/abstract&gt\"].\nThe symmetry energy \n𝐽\nJ and its slope parameter \n𝐿\nL at saturation density are within a tight range of \n𝜎\n(\n𝐽\n)\n<\n2\nσ(J)<2 MeV and \n𝜎\n(\n𝐿\n)\n<\n6\nσ(L)<6 MeV [@\"url:https://inspirehep.net/literature/1185349\",\"url:https://inspirehep.net/literature/1185349&gt\"].\nThe median symmetry energy is uniform, and for different models, the median is \n∼\n32\n∼32 MeV [@\"url:https://arxiv.org/abs/1209.2718.pdf\",\"url:https://arxiv.org/abs/1209.2718&gt\"].

A key aspect of this investigation involves understanding the impact of varying the neutron star equation of state on gravitational wave cycles.\n\nTidal Heating and Gravitational Wave Cycles\n\nThe change in the number of gravitational wave cycles due to tidal heating during inspiral is estimated in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) band. The leading dissipation number is related to the tidal heating by (\\nu^{E}{2}\\times(T{\\mathrm{K}}/10^{5})^{2}) and (\\delta\\mathcal{N}{\\mathrm{GW}}\\times(T{\\mathrm{K}}/10^{5})^{2}). The equation of state (EoS) affects the mass (M) (in (M_{\\odot})), radius (R) (in km), and the (M/R) ratio, which in turn influence the Love number (k_{2}) and the heating factor (H_{\\omega}^{E}\\times(T_{\\mathrm{K}}/10^{5})^{2}) [1].\n\nRepresentation of the Table\n\nThe table in the context represents the gravitational wave cycles due to tidal heating in symmetric spinless neutron star-neutron star binaries at a fixed temperature of ( t=10^5 , K ).\n\nInvestigating Tidal Heating\n\nTidal heating is considered in relation to its impact on the resulting gravitational wave signal. According to a study published on ResearchGate, the temperature is fixed at (t=10^5 , K) to investigate tidal heating associated with the binary inspiral of strange quark stars [2].\n\nConstraints on Tidal Deformability\n\nConstraints on tidal deformability can be tightened with accurate high-density observables from nuclear physics, highlighting the need for such observables. This information is supported by a study by CY Tsang (2020), which can be found in the source: [3].\n\nScattering Amplitude Formalism\n\nThe impact of varying the neutron star equation of state on gravitational wave cycles due to tidal heating can be studied using a scattering amplitude formalism. This approach incorporates both worldline effective field theory, as presented by MVS Saketh in2024 [4]. A similar study by B Banihashemi (2020) discusses gravitational waves emitted by coalescing binary systems containing neutron stars [5].\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the impact of varying the neutron star equation of state on gravitational wave cycles due to tidal heating in symmetric spinless neutron star-neutron star binaries at a fixed temperature of (t=10^5 , K) is an area of active research. Various studies have investigated this phenomenon using different approaches, including scattering amplitude formalism and tidal heating effects of nonspinning neutron stars [6].\n\nReferences\n\n[1] https://arxiv.org/html/2407.08327v1 [2] https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Illustration-of-the-tidal-responses-of-two-stars-in-a-quasi-circular-binary-not-to_fig1_382396219 [3] https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevC.102.045808 [4] https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.110.103001 [5] https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.101.064003 [6] https://www.researchgate.net/publication/385541304_Investigating_tidal_heating_in_neutron_stars_via_gravitational_Raman_scattering.pdf", "marvel_deepsearch_score": 8, "evaluation_model_type": "openai", "evaluation_model_name": "gpt-4o-mini", "qa_model_type": "openai", "qa_model_name": "gpt-4o-mini", "gpt4o_mini_answer_relevancy": 0.92, "gpt4o_mini_answer_correctness": 0.3, "gpt4o_mini_faithfulness": 0.05, "marvel_standard_answer_relevancy": 0.9, "marvel_standard_answer_correctness": 0.8, "marvel_standard_faithfulness": 0.92, "marvel_deepsearch_answer_relevancy": 0.965, "marvel_deepsearch_answer_correctness": 0.3, "marvel_deepsearch_faithfulness": 0.845}

The absolute magnitude of the $4~{\rm sq.~arcsec}$ region around the transient location is $-10.65$, indicating a high stellar density in the locale of the binary neutron star (BNS) coalescence, which suggests a probable dynamical interaction. This evidence leads to the inquiry of a causal connection between the minor galaxy merger and the kilonova event.", "gpt4o_mini_answer": "The evidence suggesting a recent minor galaxy merger in NGC 4993 primarily comes from observations of its morphological features and the dynamics of its stellar population. NGC 4993 is an elliptical galaxy located in the Hydra constellation, and studies have indicated that it exhibits signs of tidal interactions and asymmetries in its structure, which are characteristic of recent mergers. \n\nSpecifically, astronomers have noted features such as disturbed stellar distributions, the presence of young star clusters, and variations in the galaxy's surface brightness profile. These characteristics imply that NGC 4993 has undergone a minor merger with a smaller companion galaxy, which can trigger star formation and alter the galaxy's overall structure.\n\nThis minor merger is particularly relevant to the kilonova event observed in the region, designated as GW170817. The kilonova was the result of the merger of two neutron stars, and it was detected in August 2017 as both a gravitational wave event and an electromagnetic counterpart. The connection between the merger event and the galaxy's history is significant because the environment around NGC 4993 may have influenced the conditions leading to the neutron star merger. \n\nIn particular, the merger could have contributed to the dynamical interactions that brought the neutron stars close enough together to eventually merge. Additionally, the presence of a recent minor merger could indicate a higher rate of star formation and the presence of binary systems, which are essential for the formation of neutron star binaries. \n\nOverall, the evidence of a recent minor merger in NGC 4993 provides a contextual backdrop for understanding the kilonova event, linking the galaxy's evolutionary history with the astrophysical processes that lead to such dramatic cosmic phenomena.", "gpt4o_mini_score": 9, "marvel_standard_answer": "<QUERY> What evidence suggests a recent minor galaxy merger in NGC4993, and how does this relate to the kilonova event observed in the region?. Today is2025-08-15'. </QUERY>\n\nAfter carefully reading through the provided text documents, several pieces of evidence suggest a recent minor galaxy merger in NGC4993 and its relation to the kilonova event observed in the region can be summarized as follows:\n\n- **Shell-like structures and dust lanes**: Documents 1, 3, 4, and 5 mention the presence of shell-like structures and dust lanes in NGC4993. These features are indicative of a recent minor galaxy merger. The shells are a result of the merger between NGC4993 and a smaller disky galaxy, which occurred on a highly eccentric but nonradial trajectory (Document 3).\n\n- **Type II morphology of the shells**: Document 3 discusses the Type II morphology of the shells in NGC4993, which indicates that the galaxy accreted a smaller disky galaxy.\n\n- **Dust structure around the center of the galaxy**: Document 3 describes a rich dust structure around the center of NGC4993 with an irregular appearance. This irregularity suggests that the dust is not in hydrostatic equilibrium, further supporting the occurrence of a recent merger.\n\n- **Possible low-luminosity active galactic nucleus (AGN)**: Documents 3 and 4 mention the possible presence of a low-luminosity AGN in NGC4993, which could have been triggered by the gas brought to the central region by the intruding late-type galaxy.\n\n- **Stellar population in the vicinity of the transient**: Document 4 notes that the stellar population in the vicinity of the transient is predominantly old, with less than 1% of any light arising from a population with ages less than 500 Myr. This suggests that the merger did not trigger significant new star formation.\n\n- **Location and properties of the kilonova event**: The kilonova event, associated with the merger of two neutron stars (and the source of the gravitational waves detected as GW170817), is located close to a shell in NGC4993 (Document 1).

These features, along with the Type II morphology of the shells and the irregular dust structure around the galaxy's center, support the occurrence of a merger with a smaller disky galaxy. This merger is related to the kilonova event observed in the region, as it provided the environment in which two neutron stars merged, producing the kilonova and the gravitational wave event GW170817. </ANSWER>\n\nSources:\n- https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1422479\n- https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/aa9367\n- https://arxiv.org/html/1801.01493v5\n- https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05444.pdf\n- https://www.darkenergysurvey.org/darchive/galaxy-hosted-gravitational-wave-event-gw170817-can-teach-us-binary-neutron-stars/\n- https://news.berkeley.edu/2017/10/16/astronomers-strike-cosmic-gold/\n- https://www.eso.org/public/images/eso1733c/\n- https://www.friendsofnasa.org/2023/04/lenticular-galaxy-ngc-4993-kilonova.html\n\n# Evidence of a Recent Minor Galaxy Merger in NGC4993 and its Relation to the Kilonova Event\n## Introduction\n\nThe galaxy NGC4993, host to the optical counterpart of the gravitational-wave source GW170817, has been extensively studied due to its unique properties and the kilonova event observed within it. This event, resulting from the merger of two neutron stars, has provided valuable insights into the galaxy's recent history, including evidence of a recent minor galaxy merger.\n\n## Observations Indicating a Recent Minor Galaxy Merger\n\nSeveral observations suggest that NGC4993 has undergone a recent minor galaxy merger:\n- **Shell-like Structures and Dust Lanes**: NGC4993 presents shell-like structures and dust lanes indicative of a recent minor galaxy merger. These features are visible in images taken by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and other instruments [https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1422479](https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1422479).\n- **Irregular Dust Structure**: A rich dust structure around the center of the galaxy with an irregular appearance indicates that the dust is not in hydrostatic equilibrium. This was observed in HST images [https://arxiv.org/html/1801.01493v5](https://arxiv.org/html/1801.01493v5).\n- **Type II Morphology of Shells**: The Type II morphology of the shells in NGC4993 suggests that the galaxy accreted a smaller disky galaxy on a highly eccentric but nonradial trajectory [https://arxiv.org/html/1801.01493v5](https://arxiv.org/html/1801.01493v5).\n- **Possible Low-luminosity Active Galactic Nucleus**: A possible low-luminosity active galactic nucleus, triggered by the gas brought to the central region by the intruding late-type galaxy, has been reported [https://arxiv.org/html/1801.01493v5](https://arxiv.org/html/1801.01493v5).\n\n## Relation to the Kilonova Event\n\nThe kilonova event observed in NGC4993 is directly related to the merger of two neutron stars, which likely resulted from the recent minor galaxy merger. Key points include:\n- **Location and Stellar Density**: The kilonova event was located close to a shell, suggesting a high stellar density in the locale of the binary neutron star (BNS) coalescence. This implies that dynamical interactions between stars may still be occurring [https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1422479](https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1422479).\n- **Galaxy Properties and Short GRBs**: The properties of NGC4993, along with those of the transient location, are consistent with the distributions seen for short-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) [https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05444.pdf](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05444.pdf).\n- **Stellar Population**: The stellar population in the vicinity of the kilonova event is predominantly old, with less than 1% of any light arising from a population with ages less than 500 Myr [https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05444.pdf](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05444.pdf).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe evidence of a recent minor galaxy merger in NGC4993, along with the observed kilonova event, provides significant insights into the galaxy's evolution and the merger of neutron stars. These findings highlight the complex interactions within galaxies and the potential for such mergers to produce observable astrophysical events.\n\n## References\n- [https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1422479](https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1422479)\n- [https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/aa9367](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/aa9367)\n- [https://arxiv.org/html/1801.01493v5](https://arxiv.org/html/1801.01493v5)\n- [https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05444.pdf](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05444.pdf)\n- [https://www.darkenergysurvey.org/darchive/galaxy-hosted-gravitational-wave-event-gw170817-can-teach-us-binary-neutron-stars/](https://www.darkenergysurvey.org/darchive/galaxy-hosted-gravitational-wave-event-gw170817-can-teach-us-binary-neutron-stars/)\n- [https://news.berkeley.edu/2017/10/16/astronomers-strike-cosmic-gold/](https://news.berkeley.edu/2017/10/16/astronomers-strike-cosmic-gold/)\n- [https://www.eso.org/public/images/eso1733c/](https://www.eso.org/public/images/eso1733c/)\n- [https://www.friendsofnasa.org/2023/04/lenticular-galaxy-ngc-4993-kilonova.html](https://www.friendsofnasa.org/2023/04/lenticular-galaxy-ngc-4993-kilonova.html)", "marvel_standard_score": 8, "marvel_deepsearch_answer": "💡 Assistant is thinking", "marvel_deepsearch_score": 0, "evaluation_model_type": "openai", "evaluation_model_name": "gpt-4o-mini", "qa_model_type": "openai", "qa_model_name": "gpt-4o-mini", "gpt4o_mini_answer_relevancy": 0.92, "gpt4o_mini_answer_correctness": 0.85, "gpt4o_mini_faithfulness": 0.8, "marvel_standard_answer_relevancy": 0.98, "marvel_standard_answer_correctness": 0.9, "marvel_standard_faithfulness": 0.92, "marvel_deepsearch_answer_relevancy": 0.0, "marvel_deepsearch_answer_correctness": 1.0, "marvel_deepsearch_faithfulness": 0.05}

Here are the main purposes of applying a Tukey window in this context:\n\n1. **Reducing Spectral Leakage**: When performing a Fourier transform on a finite-length signal, discontinuities at the edges of the signal can cause spectral leakage, where energy from one frequency bin spills into others. The Tukey window smoothly tapers the signal to zero at the edges, reducing these discontinuities and thus minimizing spectral leakage.\n\n2. **Controlling Side Lobes**: The Tukey window has a parameter that allows you to control the shape of the window, balancing between a rectangular window (which has high side lobes) and a Hann window (which has lower side lobes). By adjusting the tapering, you can achieve a desired trade-off between main lobe width and side lobe levels, which is crucial for filter design.\n\n3. **Improving Frequency Response**: The application of a Tukey window can lead to a more desirable frequency response for the FIR filter. It can help in achieving a sharper cutoff and better attenuation of unwanted frequencies outside the passband.\n\n4. **Smoothing Transitions**: The tapered nature of the Tukey window allows for smoother transitions between the passband and stopband of the filter, which can be beneficial in applications where abrupt changes in frequency response are undesirable.\n\n5. **Reducing Gibbs Phenomenon**: The use of a Tukey window can help reduce the Gibbs phenomenon, which is the overshoot that occurs when approximating a discontinuous function with a finite number of harmonics. This is particularly important in applications where signal integrity is critical.\n\nIn summary, applying a Tukey window function in the process of obtaining a time-domain FIR filter helps to enhance the filter's performance by reducing spectral leakage, controlling side lobes, improving frequency response, smoothing transitions, and mitigating the Gibbs phenomenon.", "gpt4o_mini_score": 9, "marvel_standard_answer": "\n The purpose of applying a Tukey window function in obtaining a time-domain FIR filter is to improve the filter's performance by reducing Gibbs oscillations, side lobes, and the effects of truncation, thereby tapering the impulse response and smoothing its edges.\n \n\n The purpose of applying a Tukey window function in obtaining a time-domain FIR filter is to improve the filter's performance by reducing Gibbs oscillations and side lobes, and the effects of truncation.\n\n\n**Note:** This is a quick response generated by a language model, which may contain inaccuracies. \n                                                    For more detailed answers, please rephrase your question and be sure to request sources and supporting documents.\n                                                    ", "marvel_standard_score": 7, "marvel_deepsearch_answer": "Fetching Documents via Web Search", "marvel_deepsearch_score": 0, "evaluation_model_type": "openai", "evaluation_model_name": "gpt-4o-mini", "qa_model_type": "openai", "qa_model_name": "gpt-4o-mini", "gpt4o_mini_answer_relevancy": 0.95, "gpt4o_mini_answer_correctness": 0.9, "gpt4o_mini_faithfulness": 0.8, "marvel_standard_answer_relevancy": 0.95, "marvel_standard_answer_correctness": 0.9, "marvel_standard_faithfulness": 0.85, "marvel_deepsearch_answer_relevancy": 0.0, "marvel_deepsearch_answer_correctness": 0.0, "marvel_deepsearch_faithfulness": 0.0}

According to the models \\mobse1 and \\mobse2, metallicity affects the maximum mass of compact remnants in several ways:\n\n1. **Stellar Evolution Pathways**: Higher metallicity stars tend to lose more mass through stellar winds during their evolution compared to lower metallicity stars. This mass loss can influence the final mass of the star when it ends its life, which in turn affects the mass of the resulting compact remnant.\n\n2. **Core Collapse Mechanisms**: The processes leading to core collapse and the formation of neutron stars or black holes can vary with metallicity. For instance, higher metallicity can lead to more efficient cooling of the core, potentially altering the conditions under which a supernova occurs and affecting whether a neutron star or black hole is formed.\n\n3. **Threshold Masses**: The models suggest that there are different thresholds for the formation of black holes versus neutron stars that depend on metallicity. Generally, lower metallicity stars can retain more mass and may form more massive black holes, while higher metallicity stars may end up as less massive black holes or neutron stars due to increased mass loss.\n\n4. **Remnant Mass Distribution**: The distribution of remnant masses is also influenced by metallicity. For example, the maximum mass of neutron stars is thought to be relatively constant, but the maximum mass of black holes can increase with decreasing metallicity due to the reasons mentioned above.\n\nIn summary, both \\mobse1 and \\mobse2 models indicate that higher metallicity generally leads to lower maximum masses for compact remnants due to increased mass loss and changes in the stellar evolution pathways.

The MOBSE1 and MOBSE2 models include updated equations for metallicity-dependent stellar winds and core-collapse supernovae prescriptions.

According to models MOBSE1 and MOBSE2, the lower the metallicity, the higher the mass of the heaviest remnant. The maximum mass of compact remnants increases with decreasing metallicity. For example, at $Z =0.02$, the maximum remnant mass is lower compared to lower metallicities. MOBSE1 and MOBSE2 predict different maximum masses, especially at lower metallicities and for progenitor masses $>30 M_{\\odot}$. The maximum BH mass can be as high as $\\sim65 M_{\\odot}$ at low metallicity ($Z \\sim0.0002$) according to MOBSE models. At low metallicity ($Z =0.0002$), MOBSE1 predicts a maximum compact remnant mass of $\\sim50-65 M_{\\odot}$, while MOBSE2 predicts a maximum compact remnant mass of $\\sim40 M_{\\odot}$. The difference in maximum BH mass predictions is approximately $\\sim10-25 M_{\\odot}$. The metallicity dependence of the maximum compact remnant mass is addressed by MOBSE1 and MOBSE2, with MOBSE1 predicting a higher maximum mass than MOBSE2 at lower metallicities. The relationship between metallicity and compact remnant mass is essential for studying the formation and evolution of black holes and neutron stars. The maximum compact remnant mass ranges from $\\sim25 M_{\\odot}$ at $Z =2.0 \\times10^{-2}$ to $\\sim135 M_{\\odot}$ at $Z =1.0 \\times10^{-4}$ [@\"url:https://www.research.unipd.it/retrieve/e14fb26f-aefe-3de1-e053-1705fe0ac030/tesi_dottorato_Nicola_Giacobbo.pdf\",\"url:https://www.research.unipd.it/retrieve/e14fb26f-aefe-3de1-e053-1705fe0ac030/tesi_dottorato_Nicola_Giacobbo.pdf>\",\"url:https://www.research.unipd.it/bitstream/11577/3425782/1/tesi_dottorato_Nicola_Giacobbo.pdf\",\"url:https://www.research.unipd.it/bitstream/11577/3425782/1/tesi_dottorato_Nicola_Giacobbo.pdf>\",\"url:https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.03556.pdf\",\"url:https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.03556>\",\"url:https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/474/3/2959/4628068\",\"url:https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/474/3/2959/4628068>\",\"url:https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-pdf/474/3/2959/22843349/stx2933.pdf\",\"url:https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-pdf/474/3/2959/22843349/stx2933.pdf>\",\"url:https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Radius-versus-mass-of-the-CO-core-for-five-stars-with-zero-age-main-sequence-ZAMS-mass_fig1_321025160\",\"url:https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Radius-versus-mass-of-the-CO-core-for-five-stars-with-zero-age-main-sequence-ZAMS-mass_fig1_321025160>\",\"url:https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Mass-of-the-compact-remnant-M-rem-as-a-function-of-the-ZAMS-mass-of-the-progenitor_fig2_321025160\",\"url:https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Mass-of-the-compact-remnant-M-rem-as-a-function-of-the-ZAMS-mass-of-the-progenitor_fig2_321025160>\"].\nREFERENCES\n\n<TASK_OUTPUT>\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.03556.pdf\nhttps://www.memsait.it/volumi/Vol.%2092%20-%20N.1%20-%202021/2021MmSAI..1...27G.pdf\nhttps://iris.sissa.it/retrieve/dd8a4bf7-1252-20a0-e053-d805fe0a8cb0/MNRAS-2015-Spera-4086-103.pdf\nhttps://www.research.unipd.it/retrieve/e14fb26f-aefe-3de1-e053-1705fe0ac030/tesi_dottorato_Nicola_Giacobbo.pdf\nhttps://www.research.unipd.it/bitstream/11577/3425782/1/tesi_dottorato_Nicola_Giacobbo.pdf\nhttps://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/474/3/2959/4628068\nhttps://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2024/09/aa49978-24/aa49978-24.html </TASK_OUTPUT>", "marvel_deepsearch_score": 8, "evaluation_model_type": "openai", "evaluation_model_name": "gpt-4o-mini", "qa_model_type": "openai", "qa_model_name": "gpt-4o-mini", "gpt4o_mini_answer_relevancy": 0.95, "gpt4o_mini_answer_correctness": 0.85, "gpt4o_mini_faithfulness": 0.85, "marvel_standard_answer_relevancy": 0.92, "marvel_standard_answer_correctness": 0.85, "marvel_standard_faithfulness": 0.85, "marvel_deepsearch_answer_relevancy": 0.935, "marvel_deepsearch_answer_correctness": 0.92, "marvel_deepsearch_faithfulness": 0.98}

These processes can have profound implications for the stability of the accelerating regions around black holes and the characteristics of the emitted signals.\n\n### Curvature Radiation\n\n1. **Mechanism**: Curvature radiation occurs when charged particles, such as electrons, are accelerated in the strong gravitational field of a black hole, particularly in regions of high curvature, such as near the event horizon or along the magnetic field lines that may be present around the black hole.\n\n2. **Energy Emission**: As these particles accelerate, they emit radiation, which can be significant in the high-energy regime. This radiation can contribute to the overall energy output of the black hole system, potentially affecting the dynamics of the surrounding accretion disk and the outflows from the black hole.\n\n3. **Stability of the Accelerating Region**: The emission of curvature radiation can lead to energy loss for the charged particles, which may affect their stability. If the energy loss is significant, it could lead to a depletion of the particle population in the accelerating region, potentially destabilizing the system. This could result in fluctuations in the radiation output and the dynamics of the surrounding plasma.\n\n### Pair Cascades\n\n1. **Mechanism**: Pair cascades occur when high-energy photons (such as those emitted from curvature radiation) interact with the strong electromagnetic fields near the black hole, leading to the production of electron-positron pairs. This process can be particularly relevant in the context of rotating black holes, where strong magnetic fields can enhance the pair production.\n\n2. **Feedback Mechanism**: The creation of pairs can lead to a runaway effect, where the newly created particles can also emit radiation and produce more pairs, leading to a cascade of particles and radiation. This can significantly increase the energy output of the system and contribute to the overall luminosity of the black hole.\n\n3. **Signal Characteristics**: The emitted signals from these processes can be highly variable and may exhibit specific spectral features. The radiation from curvature radiation and the subsequent pair cascades can lead to the emission of high-energy gamma rays and other forms of radiation, which can be detected by observatories. The variability in the signals can provide insights into the dynamics of the black hole and its environment.\n\n### Implications for Observations\n\n1. **High-Energy Emissions**: The processes of curvature radiation and pair cascades can lead to the emission of high-energy photons, which are crucial for understanding the high-energy astrophysical phenomena associated with black holes, such as gamma-ray bursts and active galactic nuclei.\n\n2. **Astrophysical Signatures**: The characteristics of the emitted signals, including their energy spectra and variability, can provide valuable information about the properties of the black hole, such as its mass, spin, and the nature of the surrounding accretion disk.\n\n3. **Modeling and Simulations**: Understanding these processes requires sophisticated modeling and simulations to accurately capture the dynamics of particles in the strong gravitational and electromagnetic fields near black holes. This can help in predicting the expected signals and guiding observational campaigns.\n\nIn summary, curvature radiation and pair cascades play a critical role in the dynamics of black hole systems, influencing the stability of the accelerating regions and the characteristics of the emitted signals.

The gap height \\(h\\) is crucial and can be determined by \\(h^{*}_{acc} \\sim \\left(\\frac{24\\pi m_e^2 M}{e\\epsilon_{ir}BR_Ha}\\right)^{1/3}\\) in certain regimes.

The gamma-ray spectra can be characterized by a broad peak around \\(0.01-1\\) GeV and a sharp peak around \\(0.1\\) TeV. The electron-positron pair cascade in the magnetosphere of a black hole results in copious gamma-ray emissions.\n\n4. **Influence on Black Hole Systems**: In black hole systems, the implications of these processes include the potential for gamma-ray emissions to extend into higher energies with increasing VHE (Very High Energy) photon flux. The spectra of high-luminosity RIAFs have a strong imprint of pair production.\n\n5. **Morphology of Gamma-Ray Emissions**: The gamma-ray image is predicted to have a point-like morphology, and the flux changes little in a wide range of magnetospheric currents.\n\nThese findings are based on various studies and models discussed in the provided documents, including considerations of particle acceleration in vacuum gaps in black hole magnetospheres and the effects of decreasing plasma accretion.\n\n</ANSWER>\n\n# Implications of Curvature Radiation Energy and Pair Cascades in Black Hole Systems\n## Introduction\n\nThe implications of curvature radiation energy and pair cascades in the context of black hole (BH) systems are multifaceted, particularly regarding the stability of the accelerating region and the characteristics of the emitted signals. This article aims to synthesize the various perspectives and findings on this topic.\n\n## Curvature Radiation and Pair Cascades\n\nThe energy of curvature radiation is given by $E_\\gamma = \\frac{E^3}{m_e^3R} \\sim 10^9 \\left(\\frac{E}{10^{15} \\text{ eV}}\\right)^3 \\left(\\frac{M}{10^9 M_\\odot}\\right)^{-1}$ eV, and synchrotron radiation is $E_\\gamma = \\frac{eB_\\perp E^2}{m_e^3} \\sim 10^7 \\left(\\frac{B_\\perp}{1 \\text{ G}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{E}{10^{13} \\text{ eV}}\\right)^2$ eV. However, photons typically do not reach the pair production threshold [1].\n\n## Stability of the Accelerating Region\n\nThe presence of a broad energy distribution of the RIAF's photons naturally avoids instability. The gap height $h$ is determined mostly by $h^{*}_{ic}$ in the high-luminosity RIAF regime. The pair production process can limit the gap height if the potential difference in the gap accelerates electrons to energies at which inverse Compton $\\gamma$-rays start to produce pairs: $h > h^{*}_{acc} \\sim \\left(\\frac{24\\pi m_e^2 M}{e\\epsilon_{ir}BR_Ha}\\right)^{1/3}$ [2].\n\n## Characteristics of Emitted Signals\n\nThe implications of curvature radiation energy and pair cascades in black hole systems involve the creation of electron-positron pairs through the interaction of photons with thermal photons. This process can lead to a cascade, where the created pairs are accelerated, resulting in a series of events. The mechanism of $\\gamma$-ray induced pair cascades can be described by the interaction of high-energy photons with low-energy thermal photons, potentially leading to the formation of an accelerating region [3].\n\n## Black Hole Magnetosphere\n\nThe black hole induces a charge-separated magneto-sphere with polar vacuum gap regions, where the electric field of the magnetosphere has a component parallel to the magnetic field that accelerates particles to ultrarelativistic energies. Inverse Compton scattering and copious pair production due to interactions with low-energy thermal photons from the plasma accreted by the black hole lead to the observed gamma rays [4].\n\n## Gamma-Ray Emission\n\nThe electron-positron pair cascade taking place in the magnetosphere of the black hole is examined, where spacetime frame dragging leads to a change in the Goldreich-Julian charge density near the event horizon, resulting in a magnetic-field-aligned electric field $E_{\\parallel}$. This field enables electrons and positrons to be accelerated in opposite directions, emitting copious gamma rays via curvature and inverse Compton processes [5].\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the implications of curvature radiation energy and pair cascades in black hole systems are complex and multifaceted. The stability of the accelerating region and the characteristics of the emitted signals are influenced by various factors, including the soft photon spectrum and energy density, as well as the strength of the horizon magnetic field.\n\n## References\n\n[1] [https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2016/09/aa27549-15/aa27549-15.html](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2016/09/aa27549-15/aa27549-15.html)\n[2] [https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/pdf/2016/09/aa27549-15.pdf](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/pdf/2016/09/aa27549-15.pdf)\n[3] [https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/409/3/1183/1104015](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/409/3/1183/1104015)\n[4] [https://bib-pubdb1.desy.de/record/207122/files/Science-2014.1080-4.pdf](https://bib-pubdb1.desy.de/record/207122/files/Science-2014.1080-4.pdf)\n[5] [https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aae47a](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aae47a)\n\n</ARTICLE>\n</x>", "marvel_standard_score": 8, "marvel_deepsearch_answer": "KEY_FACTS\n\n<TASK_OUTPUT>\n\nThe stability of the accelerating region in black hole systems is influenced by the process of pair production and the presence of a broad energy distribution of photons in high-luminosity RIAF regimes, which naturally avoids instability [@\"url:https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2016/09/aa27549-15/aa27549-15.html\"].\nThe energy of curvature radiation is given by \n𝐸\n𝛾\n=\n𝐸\n3\n𝑚\n𝑒\n3\n𝑅\n∼\n10\n9\n(\n𝐸\n10\n15\n eV\n)\n3\n(\n𝑀\n10\n9\n𝑀\n⊙\n)\n−\n1\nE\nγ\n\t​\n\n=\nm\ne\n3\n\t​\n\nR\nE\n3\n\t​\n\n∼10\n9\n(\n10\n15\n eV\nE\n\t​\n\n)\n3\n(\n10\n9\nM\n⊙\n\t​\n\nM\n\t​\n\n)\n−1\n eV, and photons typically do not reach the pair production threshold.\nThe gap height is determined mostly by \nℎ\n𝑖\n𝑐\n∗\nh\nic\n∗\n\t​\n\n in the high-luminosity RIAF regime, and the pair production process can limit the gap height if the potential difference in the gap accelerates electrons to energies at which inverse Compton \n𝛾\nγ-rays start to produce pairs.\nThe characteristics of the emitted signals, such as gamma-ray spectra, are significantly affected by curvature radiation and inverse Compton processes, resulting in a broad peak around \n0.01\n−\n1\n0.01−1 GeV and a sharp peak around \n0.1\n0.1 TeV.\nThe electron-positron pair cascade taking place in the magnetosphere of the black hole results in copious gamma-ray emissions via curvature and inverse Compton processes.\nThe properties of the black hole's magnetosphere, specifically the strength of the magnetic field and the charge density, significantly influence the stability of the accelerating region and the characteristics of the emitted signals.\nSpacetime frame dragging leads to a change in the Goldreich-Julian charge density near the event horizon, resulting in a magnetic-field-aligned electric field that enables electrons and positrons to be accelerated in opposite directions.\nThe soft photon field surrounding the black hole is assumed to be isotropic and uniform in the Kerr–Schild FIDO frame, with a graybody spectrum, influencing pair production and gamma-ray emission.\nThe average photon energy is \n⟨\n\\var\n⟩\n=\n𝑘\n𝑇\n𝜋\n4\n/\n(\n30\n𝜁\n(\n3\n)\n)\n≈\n2.7\n𝑘\n𝑇\n⟨\\var⟩=kTπ\n4\n/(30ζ(3))≈2.7kT, playing a crucial role in the characteristics of the emitted signals.\nThe dissipation power in the gap can be calculated as \n𝐿\n𝑑\n𝑖\n𝑠\n𝑠\n=\n∫\n𝐸\n⋅\n𝑗\n𝑑\n𝑉\nL\nd\n\t​\n\niss=∫E⋅jdV, and its scaling with \n𝜏\n0\nτ\n0\n\t​\n\n and \n𝐵\n~\n0\nB\n~\n0\n\t​\n\n is found to be \n𝐿\n𝑑\n𝑖\n𝑠\n𝑠\n/\n𝐿\n𝐹\n𝐹\n=\n𝐶\n𝑓\n(\n𝜏\n0\n)\n𝐵\n~\n0\n−\n1\nL\nd\n\t​\n\niss/L\nFF\n\t​\n\n=Cf(τ\n0\n\t​\n\n)\nB\n~\n0\n−1\n\t​\n\n.\nThe properties of a black hole's ergosphere play a crucial role in the generation of curvature radiation energy and pair cascades, impacting the observed gamma-ray emissions. </TASK_OUTPUT>\nFINER_DETAILS\n\n<TASK_OUTPUT> The implications of curvature radiation energy and pair cascades in the context of black hole (BH) systems are multifaceted, particularly regarding the stability of the accelerating region and the characteristics of the emitted signals.

The presence of a broad energy distribution of photons in high-luminosity RIAF (Radiatively Inefficient Accretion Flow) regimes naturally avoids instability.\n\nThe characteristics of the emitted signals, such as gamma-ray spectra, are significantly affected by curvature radiation and inverse Compton processes. The energy of inverse Compton photons is \n𝐸\n𝛾\n≃\n𝐸\n2\n𝜖\n𝑖\n𝑟\n𝑚\n𝑒\n2\nE\nγ\n\t​\n\n≃\nϵ\nir\n\t​\n\nm\ne\n2\n\t​\n\nE\n2\n\t​\n\n, with \n𝜖\n𝑖\n𝑟\nϵ\nir\n\t​\n\n being the infrared photon energy.\n\nThe properties of a black hole's magnetosphere, specifically the strength of the magnetic field and the charge density, significantly influence the stability of the accelerating region and the characteristics of the emitted signals.\n\nThe soft photon field surrounding the black hole is assumed to be isotropic and uniform in the Kerr–Schild FIDO frame, with a graybody spectrum.\n\nThe creation of electron-positron pairs through the interaction of photons with thermal photons, and the acceleration of particles to ultrarelativistic energies, are key processes that influence the stability of the accelerating region and the characteristics of the emitted signals.\n\nThe implications of curvature radiation energy and pair cascades in black hole systems are complex and multifaceted. The stability of the accelerating region and the characteristics of the emitted signals are influenced by various factors, including the process of pair production, the properties of the black hole's magnetosphere, and the soft photon spectrum and energy density.\n\nThe electron-positron pair cascade taking place in the magnetosphere of the black hole is examined, where spacetime frame dragging leads to a change in the Goldreich-Julian charge density near the event horizon, resulting in a magnetic-field-aligned electric field \n𝐸\n∥\nE\n∥\n\t​\n\n. This field enables electrons and positrons to be accelerated in opposite directions, emitting copious gamma rays via curvature and inverse Compton processes.\n\nThe black hole induces a charge-separated magneto-sphere with polar vacuum gap regions, where the electric field of the magnetosphere has a component parallel to the magnetic field that accelerates particles to ultrarelativistic energies. Inverse Compton scattering and copious pair production due to interactions with low-energy thermal photons from the plasma accreted by the black hole lead to the observed gamma rays.\n\nThe gamma-ray spectra can be characterized by a broad peak around \n0.01\n−\n1\n0.01−1 GeV and a sharp peak around \n0.1\n0.1 TeV.\n\nThe implications of curvature radiation energy and pair cascades in black hole systems are complex and multifaceted. The stability of the accelerating region and the characteristics of the emitted signals are influenced by various factors, including the soft photon spectrum and energy density, as well as the strength of the horizon magnetic field.\n\nThe properties of a black hole's ergosphere play a crucial role in the generation of curvature radiation energy and pair cascades. The ergosphere is a region around a rotating black hole where the curvature of spacetime is so strong that it can extract energy from objects that enter it. The rotation of the black hole creates a region where the electric field is parallel to the magnetic field, which can accelerate charges to high energies, leading to the production of gamma rays and electron-positron pairs through inverse Compton scattering and pair production.\n\nThe dissipation power in the gap can be calculated as \n𝐿\n𝑑\n𝑖\n𝑠\n𝑠\n=\n∫\n𝐸\n⋅\n𝑗\n𝑑\n𝑉\nL\nd\n\t​\n\niss=∫E⋅jdV. The scaling of the dissipation power with \n𝜏\n0\nτ\n0\n\t​\n\n and \n𝐵\n~\n0\nB\n~\n0\n\t​\n\n is found to be \n𝐿\n𝑑\n𝑖\n𝑠\n𝑠\n/\n𝐿\n𝐹\n𝐹\n=\n𝐶\n𝑓\n(\n𝜏\n0\n)\n𝐵\n~\n0\n−\n1\nL\nd\n\t​\n\niss/L\nFF\n\t​\n\n=Cf(τ\n0\n\t​\n\n)\nB\n~\n0\n−1\n\t​\n\n. The simulations have implications for M87 and Sgr A*. For M87, assuming a graybody spectrum and an estimated energy density, the average dissipation rate in the gap is \n∼\n4\n×\n10\n−\n3\n∼4×10\n−3\n times the jet power. For Sgr A*, the average dissipation power in the gap may reach \n10\n36\n10\n36\n erg s\n−\n1\n−1\n, sufficient to power X-ray flares.\n\nThe implications of curvature radiation energy and pair cascades in black hole systems are complex and multifaceted. The stability of the accelerating region and the characteristics of the emitted signals are influenced by various factors, including the soft photon spectrum and energy density, as well as the strength of the horizon magnetic field. The properties of the black hole's ergosphere play a crucial role in the generation of curvature radiation energy and pair cascades, which impact the observed gamma-ray emissions.\n\nReferences: [1]

This rate is mentioned in multiple sources, including <https://academic.oup.com/mnrasl/article/463/1/L31/2589675> and <https://www.researchgate.net/publication/309574578_The_Rate_of_Binary_Black_Hole_Mergers_Inferred_from_Advanced_LIGO_Observations_Surrounding_GW150914.pdf>. </ANSWER>\n\n# Estimated Rate of Gravitational Wave Events like GW150914\n==============================================\n\nThe detection of gravitational wave events like GW150914 has provided valuable insights into the merger rates of binary black holes. Various studies have estimated the rate of such events, and the results are summarized below.\n\n## Introduction\nThe first observation of gravitational waves, GW150914, was detected on September 14, 2015, by the twin Advanced LIGO detectors. This event was identified as the merger of two black holes with masses $(m_1, m_2) = (36^{+5}_{-4}, 29^{+4}_{-4})$ M$_\\odot$ at redshift $z = 0.09^{+0.03}_{-0.04}$.\n\n## Estimated Merger Rates\nThe estimated merger rates for binary black hole mergers, expressed in Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$, vary across different studies:\n\n* $2-53$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$, as reported by Abbott et al. (2016a) [1]\n* $2-400$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$, based on various models, including the standard model, chemically homogeneous evolution, isolated binaries, and dense stellar environments [2]\n* $83^{+168}_{-63}$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$, $61^{+124}_{-48}$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$, and $200^{+400}_{-160}$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ [3]\n* $17^{+39}_{-13}$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$, which lowered the previous upper limit rate from ~140 Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ [4]\n* $>2$ events Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$, as suggested by the lower bound on the event rate [5]\n* $>~1$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$, consistent with the higher end of rate predictions from both types of formation models [6]\n* $2--600$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$, considering various assumptions about the distribution of BBHs in the universe [7]\n\n## Conclusion\nThe estimated rate of gravitational wave events like GW150914 varies across different studies, but most estimates suggest a rate of at least a few events per Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$. Further observations and refinements in analysis techniques are expected to provide more accurate estimates of the merger rates.\n\n## References\n[1] [https://academic.oup.com/mnrasl/article/463/1/L31/2589675](https://academic.oup.com/mnrasl/article/463/1/L31/2589675)\n[2] [https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/bitstreams/3f0e8b0a-1e55-4613-a499-7d46a55a08d5/download](https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/bitstreams/3f0e8b0a-1e55-4613-a499-7d46a55a08d5/download)\n[3] [https://cplberry.com/2016/02/23/gw150914-the-papers/](https://cplberry.com/2016/02/23/gw150914-the-papers/)\n[4] [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_observation_of_gravitational_waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_observation_of_gravitational_waves)\n[5] [https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08338](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08338)\n[6] [https://dcc.ligo.org/LIGO-P1500262/public](https://dcc.ligo.org/LIGO-P1500262/public)\n[7] [https://dcc.ligo.org/LIGO-P1500217/public](https://dcc.ligo.org/LIGO-P1500217/public)", "marvel_standard_score": 5, "marvel_deepsearch_answer": "KEY_FACTS\n\n<TASK_OUTPUT>\n\nThe estimated rate of gravitational wave events like GW150914 is \n2\n–\n53\n2–53 Gpc\n−\n3\n−3\n yr\n−\n1\n−1\n [@\"url:https://academic.oup.com/mnrasl/article/463/1/L31/2589675\"].\nAnother study estimates the merger rate \n𝑅\n3\n(\n𝑡\n0\n)\nR\n3\n\t​\n\n(t\n0\n\t​\n\n) to be \n12\n−\n213\n \nGpc\n−\n3\nyr\n−\n1\n12−213Gpc\n−3\nyr\n−1\n [@\"url:https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.01480.pdf\"].\nThe rate of binary black hole mergers is also expressed as \n1\n7\n−\n13\n+\n39\n17\n−13\n+39\n\t​\n\n Gpc\n−\n3\n−3\n yr\n−\n1\n−1\n [@\"url:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_observation_of_gravitational_waves\"].\nOther estimates include \n2\n−\n400\n2−400 Gpc\n−\n3\n−3\n yr\n−\n1\n−1\n [@\"url:https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/bitstreams/3f0e8b0a-1e55-4613-a499-7d46a55a08d5/download\"] and \n>\n2\n>2 events Gpc\n−\n3\n−3\n yr\n−\n1\n−1\n [@\"url:https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08338\"].\nAdditional estimates range from \n2\n−\n−\n600\n2−−600 Gpc\n−\n3\n−3\n yr\n−\n1\n−1\n [@\"url:https://dcc.ligo.org/LIGO-P1500217/public\"] and \n>\n \n1\n> 1 Gpc\n−\n3\n−3\n yr\n−\n1\n−1\n [@\"url:https://dcc.ligo.org/LIGO-P1500262/public\"]. </TASK_OUTPUT>\nFINER_DETAILS\n\n<TASK_OUTPUT> The estimated rate of gravitational wave events like GW150914 can be calculated using the provided equation \n𝑅\n=\n𝑑\n𝑁\n𝑔\n𝑎\n𝑙\n𝑑\n𝑉\n×\n𝑁\n𝑆\n𝐹\n×\n𝑓\n𝑧\n×\n𝑓\n𝑚\n𝑎\n𝑠\n𝑠\n×\n𝑓\n𝑠\n𝑒\n𝑝\nR=\ndV\ndN\ngal\n\t​\n\n\t​\n\n×NSF×f\nz\n\t​\n\n×f\nmass\n\t​\n\n×f\nsep\n\t​\n\n, where \n𝑑\n𝑁\n𝑔\n𝑎\n𝑙\n𝑑\n𝑉\ndV\ndN\ngal\n\t​\n\n\t​\n\n is the number density of galaxies, \n𝑁\n𝑆\n𝐹\nNSF is the rate of stars formed per galaxy per unit time, \n𝑓\n𝑧\nf\nz\n\t​\n\n is the fraction of stars formed at metallicities of interest, \n𝑓\n𝑚\n𝑎\n𝑠\n𝑠\nf\nmass\n\t​\n\n is the fraction of stars formed in binaries in the mass range of interest, and \n𝑓\n𝑠\n𝑒\n𝑝\nf\nsep\n\t​\n\n is the fraction of binaries in the required range of separations [@\"url:https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/bitstreams/3f0e8b0a-1e55-4613-a499-7d46a55a08d5/download\"].

In ellipsoidal-collapse models, the threshold overdensity is used to determine the conditions under which a region of the universe will collapse to form a halo.\n\n### Significance of Threshold Overdensity\n\n1. **Collapse Criteria**: The threshold overdensity, often denoted as \\(\\delta_c\\), represents the critical density contrast that a region must exceed for gravitational collapse to occur. In spherical collapse models, this value is typically around 1.686 in a matter-dominated universe. However, in ellipsoidal-collapse models, which account for the non-spherical nature of collapsing structures, this threshold can vary depending on the shape and dynamics of the collapsing region.\n\n2. **Ellipsoidal Collapse**: Ellipsoidal-collapse models extend the spherical collapse framework by considering the anisotropic nature of gravitational collapse. These models suggest that the threshold overdensity can be lower than the spherical case due to the effects of tidal forces and the shape of the collapsing region. This leads to a more accurate description of how structures form in the universe.\n\n3. **Relation to Halo Formation**: The threshold overdensity is directly related to the formation of halos. When regions of the universe exceed this overdensity, they are likely to collapse and form gravitationally bound structures, or halos. The value of \\(\\delta_c\\) influences the mass scale of halos that can form, as it determines the minimum density contrast required for collapse.\n\n### Relation to Halo Mass Function\n\n1. **Halo Mass Function**: The halo mass function describes the number density of halos as a function of their mass. It is a key prediction of cosmological models and is influenced by the underlying density field and the threshold overdensity.\n\n2. **Press-Schechter Formalism**: The classic Press-Schechter theory relates the threshold overdensity to the halo mass function. In this framework, the mass function can be derived by considering the fraction of the volume of the universe that exceeds the threshold overdensity at a given mass scale. The threshold overdensity determines the mass scale at which halos can form, thus influencing the shape and normalization of the mass function.\n\n3. **Impact of Cosmological Parameters**: The value of \\(\\delta_c\\) can also depend on cosmological parameters such as the matter density, the expansion rate, and the equation of state of dark energy. Changes in these parameters can shift the threshold overdensity, which in turn affects the halo mass function and the abundance of different mass scales of halos.\n\n### Summary\n\nIn summary, the threshold overdensity is a fundamental parameter in ellipsoidal-collapse models that determines the conditions for gravitational collapse and the formation of dark matter halos. It plays a crucial role in shaping the halo mass function, influencing the abundance and distribution of halos in the universe. Understanding this relationship is essential for making predictions about structure formation and the evolution of the universe.", "gpt4o_mini_score": 9, "marvel_standard_answer": "<QUERY> 'What is the significance of the threshold overdensity in the context of ellipsoidal-collapse models and how does it relate to the halo mass function?' </QUERY>\n\nThe significance of the threshold overdensity in the context of ellipsoidal-collapse models lies in its mass dependence, which contrasts with the spherical collapse model where the threshold overdensity $\\delta_c$ is independent of halo mass.

The threshold overdensity $\\delta_c$ can be approximated as $1.686$ and is used in formalisms like the Sheth-Tormen model to estimate the abundance of dark matter halos as a function of mass and redshift. </ANSWER>\n\nSources/Citations/URL:\n- https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10545740/\n- https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-42958-6\n- https://arxiv.org/html/2405.20256v2\n- https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9907024\n- https://wwwmpa.mpa-garching.mpg.de/~swhite/talk/Ringberg21.pdf.pdf\n- https://arxiv.org/html/2406.03829v1\n- https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/696/1/636\n- https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2001MNRAS.323....1S/abstract\n- https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/pdf/2001/07/aah2421.pdf\n- https://edocs.tib.eu/files/e001/321776054l.pdf\n- https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/445/4/4110/1752383\n- https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/433/2/1230/1747663\n- https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2010/10/aa14147-10/aa14147-10.html\n- https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008MNRAS.387L..13Z/abstract\n- https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/323/1/1/1000196\n- https://arxiv.org/abs/1107.1251.pdf\n- https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/346/2/565/1475045\n- https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.111.231303.pdf\n\n# The Significance of Threshold Overdensity in Ellipsoidal-Collapse Models and Its Relation to the Halo Mass Function\n\nThe threshold overdensity plays a crucial role in the context of ellipsoidal-collapse models, particularly in its relation to the halo mass function. In the spherical collapse model, the threshold overdensity $\\delta_c$ is independent of halo mass. However, in ellipsoidal collapse models, $\\delta_c$ is mass-dependent, leading to a modification of the halo mass function, often referred to as the Sheth-Tormen (ST) model. This modification aims to improve the prediction of the shape and evolution of the mass function, as the spherical collapse model tends to overestimate the number of low-mass haloes and underestimate the number of massive haloes, especially at high redshifts.\n\n## Understanding the Threshold Overdensity\n\nThe threshold overdensity, denoted as $\\delta_{\\rm sc}$, is nearly unaffected by the halo mass in the ellipsoidal-collapse model and can be approximated as $1.686$ within a narrow redshift range. The Sheth and Tormen (ST) formalism, based on this model, tends to overestimate the number of halos at high masses. The ST formalism is founded upon an ellipsoidal-collapse model, demonstrating improved concordance with simulation data.\n\n## Ellipsoidal Collapse Model\n\nIn the ellipsoidal model, the collapse of a region depends on both the surrounding shear field and its initial overdensity. This leads to a density threshold value required for collapse, denoted as $\\delta_{ec}(m)$, which is related to the mass of the final object. The relation can be described by a fitting function for initially Gaussian fields, facilitating the inclusion of ellipsoidal dynamics in the excursion set approach.\n\n## Halo Mass Function\n\nThe halo mass function is an intrinsic property of self-gravitating collisionless dark matter systems, independent of spherical or ellipsoidal collapse models. A new approach is taken to derive the halo mass function based on the random walk of haloes in mass space, which is a direct result of inverse mass cascade in dark matter flow. The inverse mass cascade leads to a halo random walk in mass space with a waiting time $\\tau_g \\propto m_h^{-\\lambda}$, where $m_h$ is the halo mass and $\\lambda$ is a halo geometry parameter.\n\n## Derivation of Halo Mass Function\n\nThe Fokker-Planck solution for halo random walk in mass space gives rise to the halo mass function with a power-law behavior on small scale and exponential decay on large scale. The double-$\\lambda$ mass function can be written as $f_{D\\lambda} (\\nu) = \\frac{p\\left(2\\sqrt{\\eta_{0}}\\right)^{-q} }{\\Gamma \\left({q/2}\\right)}{\\nu }^{\\frac{pq}{2}-1} \\exp \\left(-\\frac{{\\nu }^p }{4\\eta_{0} }\\right)$, where model parameters $p$ and $q$ have clear physical meaning, related to halo geometry parameters $\\lambda_1$ and $\\lambda_2$.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe significance of the threshold overdensity in ellipsoidal-collapse models lies in its mass dependence, which contrasts with the spherical collapse model. The ellipsoidal collapse model provides a more accurate description of the halo mass function, particularly at high redshifts. The halo mass function is an intrinsic property of self-gravitating collisionless dark matter systems, independent of any simplified collapse models.\n\nSources:\n- https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10545740/\n- https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-42958-6\n- https://arxiv.org/html/2405.20256v2\n- https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9907024\n- https://wwwmpa.mpa-garching.mpg.de/~swhite/talk/Ringberg21.pdf.pdf\n- https://arxiv.org/html/2406.03829v1\n- https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/696/1/636\n- https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2001MNRAS.323....1S/abstract\n- https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/pdf/2001/07/aah2421.pdf\n- https://edocs.tib.eu/files/e001/321776054l.pdf\n- https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/445/4/4110/1752383\n- https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/433/2/1230/1747663\n- https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2010/10/aa14147-10/aa14147-10.html\n- https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008MNRAS.387L..13Z/abstract\n- https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/323/1/1/1000196\n- https://arxiv.org/abs/1107.1251\n- https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/346/2/565/1475045\n- https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.111.231303", "marvel_standard_score": 8, "marvel_deepsearch_answer": "Fetching Documents via Web Search", "marvel_deepsearch_score": 0, "evaluation_model_type": "openai", "evaluation_model_name": "gpt-4o-mini", "qa_model_type": "openai", "qa_model_name": "gpt-4o-mini", "gpt4o_mini_answer_relevancy": 0.95, "gpt4o_mini_answer_correctness": 0.85, "gpt4o_mini_faithfulness": 0.85, "marvel_standard_answer_relevancy": 0.92, "marvel_standard_answer_correctness": 0.87, "marvel_standard_faithfulness": 0.87, "marvel_deepsearch_answer_relevancy": 0.0, "marvel_deepsearch_answer_correctness": 0.0, "marvel_deepsearch_faithfulness": 0.0}

This approach is particularly useful in Bayesian statistics, where we want to model uncertainty and incorporate prior beliefs about the parameters of interest.\n\n### Key Roles of Hierarchical Structure in Finite Mixture Priors for Spectral Density:\n\n1. **Modeling Complexity**: Stationary time series can exhibit complex behaviors that are not easily captured by simple models. A finite mixture prior allows for the representation of different underlying processes or regimes within the same time series. The hierarchical structure helps to organize these mixtures, allowing for a more flexible modeling framework.\n\n2. **Parameter Sharing**: In a hierarchical model, parameters can be shared across different components of the mixture. This sharing can lead to more robust estimates, especially when data is limited. For instance, the hyperparameters at the top level of the hierarchy can influence the parameters of the individual mixture components, allowing for a coherent structure that captures the overall behavior of the spectral density.\n\n3. **Incorporating Prior Information**: The hierarchical structure allows for the incorporation of prior beliefs at different levels. For example, one might have prior knowledge about the overall shape of the spectral density or the number of components in the mixture. This can be encoded in the hyperparameters, which can be estimated from the data or set based on expert knowledge.\n\n4. **Flexibility in Model Specification**: The use of a finite mixture model allows for the specification of different spectral densities for different segments of the time series. The hierarchical structure can facilitate the modeling of transitions between these segments, capturing changes in the underlying process over time.\n\n5. **Bayesian Inference**: In a Bayesian framework, the hierarchical structure aids in the computation of posterior distributions. By structuring the model hierarchically, one can use techniques such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to sample from the posterior distribution of the parameters, which can be complex due to the mixture nature of the model.\n\n6. **Regularization**: The hierarchical structure can act as a form of regularization, helping to prevent overfitting by imposing constraints on the mixture components. This is particularly important in time series analysis, where the number of observations may be limited compared to the number of parameters being estimated.\n\n7. **Interpretability**: Hierarchical models can enhance interpretability by clearly delineating different levels of variation in the data. For instance, one level might capture the overall trend, while another captures local fluctuations, making it easier to understand the underlying processes driving the time series.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, the hierarchical structure in providing a finite mixture prior for spectral density in stationary time series serves to enhance model flexibility, incorporate prior information, facilitate Bayesian inference, and improve interpretability.

This is achieved through various approaches, including mixture modeling and Bayesian inference.\n\n## Introduction to Mixture Modeling\n--------------------------------\n\nA finite-dimensional mixture model is a hierarchical model consisting of the following components:\n- $N$ random variables that are observed, each distributed according to a mixture of $K$ components, with the components belonging to the same parametric family of distributions\n- $N$ random latent variables specifying the identity of the mixture component of each observation, each distributed according to a $K$-dimensional categorical distribution\n- A set of $K$ mixture weights, which are probabilities that sum to $1$\n- A set of $K$ parameters, each specifying the parameter of the corresponding mixture component\n\nMathematically, a basic parametric mixture model can be described as follows:\nLet $K$ = number of mixture components, $N$ = number of observations, $\\theta_{i=1 \\dots K}$ = parameter of distribution of observation associated with component $i$, $\\phi_{i=1 \\dots K}$ = mixture weight, $z_{i=1 \\dots N}$ = component of observation $i$, $x_{i=1 \\dots N}$ = observation $i$, $F(x|\\theta)$ = probability distribution of an observation, parametrized on $\\theta$.\nThen, $z_{i=1 \\dots N} \\sim \\operatorname{Categorical}(\\boldsymbol{\\phi})$ and $x_{i=1 \\dots N} | z_{i=1 \\dots N} \\sim F(\\theta_{z_i})$ [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixture_model].\n\n## Hierarchical Structure for Spectral Density\n------------------------------------------\n\nThe spectral density of a stationary time series, {Xt}, is given by f(ν), for −1/2 < ν ≤1/2, where f(ν) is bounded and positive. A hierarchical structure is used to model the log of the spectral density, gs(ν), as a mixture of an unknown but finite number of spectra: $gs(ν) = \\sum_{j=1}^{J} gjs(ν) Pr(j)$, where J is the maximum number of components, Pr(j) is the prior probability that the mixture contains j components, and gjs(ν) is the log of the spectral density of a mixture of j components in segment s [http://www.stat.pitt.edu/stoffer/dss_files/mix.pdf].\n\n## Bayesian Approach for Mixture Modeling\n--------------------------------------\n\nThe mixture modeling approach for a single spectral density is amenable to extensions for hierarchical modeling of multiple spectral densities, assuming $n$ realizations $x_1, \\ldots, x_n$ from a zero-mean stationary time series $\\{X_t : t =1,2, \\ldots\\}$. The implied prior model for $\\log(f(\\omega))$ enables a wide range of shapes for smooth spectral densities, with the mixture representation of the log-spectral density facilitating extensions to hierarchical modeling in the multiple time series setting [https://tr.soe.ucsc.edu/sites/default/files/technical-reports/UCSC-SOE-15-04.pdf].\n\n## Hierarchical Prior for Spectral Density\n----------------------------------------\n\nThe hierarchical structure plays a crucial role in providing a finite mixture prior for spectral density in stationary time series by allowing for a flexible and parsimonious representation of the log-spectral density. This is achieved through a Gaussian mixture model with frequency-dependent mixture weights and mean functions. The model assumes that the log-periodogram of each series is a mixture of Gaussian distributions with common variance parameter $\\sigma^2$ and mean functions $\\alpha_k + \\beta_k\\omega_j$, where $k =1, ..., K$ [https://tr.soe.ucsc.edu/sites/default/files/technical-reports/UCSC-SOE-16-15.pdf].\n\n## Conclusion\n----------\n\nIn conclusion, the hierarchical structure plays a vital role in providing a finite mixture prior for spectral density in stationary time series. Various approaches, including mixture modeling and Bayesian inference, have been proposed to model the spectral density of a stationary time series. These approaches enable a flexible and parsimonious representation of the log-spectral density, facilitating extensions to hierarchical modeling in the multiple time series setting.\n\n## References\n--------------\n\n* [https://tr.soe.ucsc.edu/sites/default/files/technical-reports/UCSC-SOE-15-04.pdf](https://tr.soe.ucsc.edu/sites/default/files/technical-reports/UCSC-SOE-15-04.pdf)\n* [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167715217300573](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167715217300573)\n* [https://www.auai.org/uai2015/proceedings/papers/227.pdf](https://www.auai.org/uai2015/proceedings/papers/227.pdf)\n* [https://tr.soe.ucsc.edu/sites/default/files/technical-reports/UCSC-SOE-16-15.pdf](https://tr.soe.ucsc.edu/sites/default/files/technical-reports/UCSC-SOE-16-15.pdf)\n* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixture_model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixture_model)\n* [http://www.stat.pitt.edu/stoffer/dss_files/mix.pdf](http://www.stat.pitt.edu/stoffer/dss_files/mix.pdf)\n* [https://projecteuclid.org/journals/bayesian-analysis/volume-15/issue-1/Determinantal-Point-Process-Mixtures-Via-Spectral-Density-Approach/10.1214/19-BA1150.pdf](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/bayesian-analysis/volume-15/issue-1/Determinantal-Point-Process-Mixtures-Via-Spectral-Density-Approach/10.1214/19-BA1150.pdf)", "marvel_standard_score": 8, "marvel_deepsearch_answer": "Fetching Documents via Web Search", "marvel_deepsearch_score": 0, "evaluation_model_type": "openai", "evaluation_model_name": "gpt-4o-mini", "qa_model_type": "openai", "qa_model_name": "gpt-4o-mini", "gpt4o_mini_answer_relevancy": 0.95, "gpt4o_mini_answer_correctness": 0.87, "gpt4o_mini_faithfulness": 0.95, "marvel_standard_answer_relevancy": 0.98, "marvel_standard_answer_correctness": 0.92, "marvel_standard_faithfulness": 0.98, "marvel_deepsearch_answer_relevancy": 0.0, "marvel_deepsearch_answer_correctness": 0.0, "marvel_deepsearch_faithfulness": 0.0}

In this article, we will discuss the key components of the LaTeX document structure for scientific papers.\n\n## Basic Structure\n---------------\n\nA basic LaTeX document structure consists of a preamble and the document body. The preamble defines the document class, packages to be used, and custom commands. The document body contains the content of the document. LaTeX employs a markup language, which is a set of commands and instructions embedded within the document's text, used to define elements like headings, paragraphs, fonts, mathematical equations, and citations.\n\n## Key Components\n----------------\n\nThe key components of a LaTeX document structure for a scientific paper include:\n\n*   **Document Class Declaration**: The document class is declared using the `\\documentclass` command, e.g., `\\documentclass{article}`.\n*   **Package Imports**: Packages are imported using the `\\usepackage` command, e.g., `\\usepackage{spconf, amsmath, graphicx}`.\n*   **Custom Definitions**: Custom definitions can be made using the `\\def` command, e.g., `\\def\\x{{\\mathbf x}}`.\n*   **Title Section**: The title section includes the title, author, and address.\n*   **Introduction and Other Sections**: Sections are created using the `\\section` command, e.g., `\\section{Introduction and Background}`.\n*   **Figures and Tables**: Figures and tables are inserted using the `figure` and `table` environments, respectively.\n*   **Equations**: Equations are inserted using the `equation` environment or inline math mode with `$` delimiters.\n\n## Best Practices\n----------------\n\nSome best practices for writing a LaTeX document for a scientific paper include:\n\n*   **Clearly Describe Image Processing**: Clearly describe any image processing applied to images.\n*   **Give Credit to Collaborators**: Give appropriate credit to collaborators.\n*   **Use Active Voice**: Use the active voice.\n*   **Avoid Pronouns**: Avoid using pronouns.\n*   **Define Acronyms and Symbols**: Define all acronyms and symbols at first use.\n\n## Common Templates and Resources\n---------------------------------\n\nThere are many templates and resources available for LaTeX users, including:\n\n*   **Springer Nature Templates**: Springer Nature provides templates for LaTeX users that help structure the manuscript.\n*   **IEEE Templates**: IEEE provides LaTeX templates for conference papers and journals.\n*   **Overleaf Templates**: Overleaf provides a wide range of LaTeX templates for various journals and publications.\n\n## Conclusion\n----------\n\nIn conclusion, the LaTeX document structure for a scientific paper consists of several key components, including the document class declaration, package imports, custom definitions, title section, introduction and other sections, figures and tables, and equations. By following best practices and using available templates and resources, authors can create well-formatted and organized scientific papers using LaTeX.\n\n### References\n\n*   [Mastering LaTeX: A Powerful Tool for Scientific Document Preparation](https://falconediting.com/en/blog/mastering-latex-a-powerful-tool-for-scientific-document-preparation/)\n*   [LaTeX Document Structure](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Document_Structure)\n*   [LaTeX for Scientific Writing](https://scholarly.so/blog/how-to-use-latex-for-scientific-writing-a-comprehensive-guide)\n*   [LaTeX Templates](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/tagged/academic-journal)", "marvel_standard_score": 8, "marvel_deepsearch_answer": "Fetching Documents via Web Search", "marvel_deepsearch_score": 0, "evaluation_model_type": "openai", "evaluation_model_name": "gpt-4o-mini", "qa_model_type": "openai", "qa_model_name": "gpt-4o-mini", "gpt4o_mini_answer_relevancy": 0.98, "gpt4o_mini_answer_correctness": 0.98, "gpt4o_mini_faithfulness": 0.05, "marvel_standard_answer_relevancy": 0.0, "marvel_standard_answer_correctness": 0.85, "marvel_standard_faithfulness": 0.0, "marvel_deepsearch_answer_relevancy": 0.0, "marvel_deepsearch_answer_correctness": 0.0, "marvel_deepsearch_faithfulness": 0.0}

Gupta's approach simplifies the quantization procedure by restricting the gravitational field to two physical polarization levels, which eliminates the need for the constraint condition for physical states, allowing for a focus on leading order interactions involving incoming and outgoing gravitons.", "gpt4o_mini_answer": "In the context of quantizing the gravitational field, the constraint condition plays a crucial role because gravity, described by General Relativity, is fundamentally different from other fields in that it is a gauge theory. The gravitational field is represented by the metric tensor, and the dynamics of this field are governed by Einstein's equations. When attempting to quantize gravity, one encounters constraints that arise from the diffeomorphism invariance of the theory, which reflects the fact that the physical content of the theory does not depend on the choice of coordinates.\n\nThe primary constraints in the context of canonical quantization of gravity are the Hamiltonian constraint and the momentum constraints. These constraints ensure that physical states in the quantum theory are invariant under diffeomorphisms, meaning they respect the underlying geometric nature of spacetime. The presence of these constraints complicates the quantization process because one must ensure that the resulting quantum states satisfy these conditions, leading to a more complex structure than in non-gravitational quantum field theories.\n\nGupta's approach, often referred to as the Gupta-Bleuler formalism, simplifies the quantization procedure by introducing a systematic way to handle these constraints. In this approach, Gupta proposed a method for quantizing fields that incorporates the constraints directly into the formulation of the theory. Specifically, he introduced the concept of \"ghost fields\" and a method for dealing with the indefinite metric in the Hilbert space, which allows for a more straightforward treatment of the constraints.\n\nBy using Gupta's method, one can construct a consistent quantum theory of gravity that respects the gauge invariance and the associated constraints. This approach helps to avoid some of the pitfalls of traditional quantization methods, such as the appearance of unphysical states or inconsistencies in the theory. Overall, Gupta's approach provides a framework that facilitates the quantization of the gravitational field while ensuring that the essential features of the theory, such as diffeomorphism invariance, are preserved.", "gpt4o_mini_score": 9, "marvel_standard_answer": "<QUERY> What is the significance of the constraint condition in the context of quantizing the gravitational field, and how does Gupta s approach simplify the quantization procedure? </QUERY>\n\nAfter carefully reading the provided <TEXT> from multiple documents, I will perform a needle-in-a-haystack search to find the <ANSWER> to the <QUERY>.\n\nThe constraint condition in the context of quantizing the gravitational field is significant because it helps avoid the problem of lack of unitarity for the S matrix, which is a crucial requirement for a consistent quantum field theory. According to **Document1**, the constraint condition ensures that the $S$ matrix is unitary, which is essential for a consistent quantum field theory.\n\nGupta's approach simplifies the quantization procedure by choosing a new constraint for the theory that differs from his previous one.

Gupta's approach simplifies the quantization procedure by choosing a new constraint for the theory, $\\phi_{\\mu\\mu} =0$, which eliminates the need for ghosts and ensures unitarity for any finite perturbative order. This approach, based on the Schwinger-Feynman variational principle, provides a more rigorous and appropriate quantization method, particularly in the presence of derivative couplings. </ANSWER>\n\nSources/Citations/URL:\n- https://inspirehep.net/literature/1790550\n- https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.00377.pdf\n- https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.00377.pdf\n- https://jhap.du.ac.ir/article_446_1a2eb5ae6b6ff0f1815822a641b43a36.pdf\n- https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2399-6528/ab8178\n- https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0370-1298/65/8/304\n- https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0370269313006011\n\n# Quantization of the Gravitational Field: Significance of Constraint Condition and Gupta's Approach\n## Introduction\n\nThe quantization of the gravitational field is a crucial aspect of reconciling general relativity with quantum field theories. A significant challenge in this endeavor is ensuring the unitarity of the S-matrix, which is essential for a consistent quantum field theory. In this article, we discuss the significance of the constraint condition in the context of quantizing the gravitational field and how Gupta's approach simplifies the quantization procedure.\n\n## The Constraint Condition: Ensuring Unitarity\n\nThe constraint condition plays a vital role in avoiding the problem of lack of unitarity for the S-matrix, which afflicts the procedures of Gupta and Feynman. By choosing a new constraint for the theory that differs from Gupta's one, the handling of constraints is significantly simplified, eliminating the need to appeal to ghosts for guaranteeing the unitarity of the S-matrix. This is achieved in the context of the Einstein Lagrangian, elaborated by Gupta (Gupta, Proc. Phys. Soc. A, 65, 161), and utilizing the Schwinger-Feynman variational principle for quantization.\n\n## Gupta's Approach: Simplifying Quantization\n\nGupta's approach simplifies the quantization procedure by imposing a constraint condition. The theory obtained via the quantization approach is similar to Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), specifically the Gupta-Bleuler approach, implying that the theory remains unitary for any finite value. The energy-momentum tensor is given by $T^{\\lambda\\rho} = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\phi_{\\lambda\\rho}}$. The graviton field can be expanded as $\\phi_{\\mu \\nu} = \\frac{1}{(2\\pi)^3} \\int \\frac{a_{\\mu \\nu}(\\vec{k})}{\\sqrt{2k_0}} e^{ik_{\\mu}x^{\\mu}} + \\frac{a^{+}_{\\mu \\nu}(\\vec{k})}{\\sqrt{2k_0}} e^{-ik_{\\mu}x^{\\mu}} d^3k$.\n\n## Mathematical Framework\n\nThe methodology is based on the Schwinger-Feynman variational principle, considered more appropriate and rigorous than the functional integral method in the presence of derivative couplings. The mathematics developed in A. Plastino, M. C. Rocca: J. Phys. Commun. **2**, 115029 (2018) is applied. The action can be expressed as $$S = \\int d^4x \\sqrt{-g} \\left(\\frac{1}{16\\pi G} R + \\mathcal{L}_{matter} \\right),$$ where $S$ is the action, $g$ is the determinant of the metric tensor, $G$ is the gravitational constant, $R$ is the Ricci scalar, and $\\mathcal{L}_{matter}$ is the matter Lagrangian.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the constraint condition plays a crucial role in ensuring the unitarity of the S-matrix in the quantization of the gravitational field. Gupta's approach simplifies the quantization procedure by imposing a constraint condition, eliminating the need for ghost particles to ensure the theory's unitarity.
