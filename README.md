# MARVEL: A Multi‑Agent Research Validator and Enabler using LLMs

MARVEL is a locally deployable, open‑source framework for domain‑aware question answering and assisted research. It combines a fast path for straightforward queries with a DeepSearch mode that integrates retrieval‑augmented generation (RAG) and Monte‑Carlo Tree Search to explore complementary sub‑queries and synthesise evidence without duplication. It draws on a curated semantic index of arXiv literature, theses, public LIGO documents and logbooks, and targeted web searches, with stable citation tracking throughout. Evaluations show MARVEL performs comparably to commercial systems on literature‑focused questions and significantly better on detector‑operations queries. The system ships as an auditable, lab‑hosted service and can be adapted to other scientific domains without sending data outside the system.
