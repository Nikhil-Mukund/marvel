# MARVEL
MARVEL is a locally deployable, open-source scientific assistant for domain-aware QA. Fast path + DeepSearch (RAG+MCTS) explores subqueries, allocates compute, and maintains an evidence ledger. Demonstrated for astrophysics and LIGO detector operations. Runs on authenticated networks; keeps data on-prem.
